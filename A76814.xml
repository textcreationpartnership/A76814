         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>UR Lord Jeſus in this Chapter, is laying down ſome certain fore-run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and of his own coming: He is anſwering that queſtion, which you will find the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples put to him, what the ſigns ſhould
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:171179:6"/> be, and what ſhould be the fore-run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and alſo what ſhould precede his own appearance and coming; and he tells them that there ſhould be providences very amazing and dreadful, that ſhould be the Antecedents of both: So it is expreſſed in the 25, 26. <hi>verſes, And there ſhall be ſigns in the Sun, and in the Moon, and in the Stars, and upon the earth diſtreſs,</hi> and diſtreſs not limited and conſined to a little corner only, <hi>but diſtreſs of Nations;</hi> and the diſtreſs of Nations ſhould have this effect, <hi>Mens hearts ſhould fail them for fear, and for looking at the things that were coming on.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now conſidering thoſe things that were to come to paſs, our Lord ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns a ſerious and weighty piece of counſel for the directing of his own poor diſciples, what they were to do, and how they were to carry it; that ye have in the words I have read, <hi>Watch ye,</hi> &amp;c. In which words you have theſe three things obſervable, among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Dreadful things ſuppoſed, and that you have in that expreſſion, <hi>Theſe
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:171179:6"/> things that ſhall come to paſs;</hi> that is, theſe wonderful, amazing and tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous providences that I have hinted to you.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You have a double duty impoſed and given in charge, to the poor Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Chriſt, and that is, Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and Prayer; well, ſaith he, watch ye and pray, I (ſaith he) and pray al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways; not always in every time, that is not the meaning; but pray always in every ſeaſon (as the originall word is properly to be underſtood) pray in every ſeaſon, be as much at it as you can; get to it in every opportunity you can meet with, and follow the work cloſely.</p>
            <p>And then 3. You have a double end propoſed, to which theſe duties are a means; and that is, firſt, The eſcaping the ſhock and weight of theſe dreadful providences; And ſecondly, after that, the being enabled <hi>to ſtand before the Son of man:</hi> For truely that is that we are to have a look unto, and not onely to fix the eye upon and be anxious about preſent Diſpenſations, and the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering through ſuch a ſtorm, but how to <hi>ſtand before the Son of man,</hi> which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:171179:7"/> will be more weighty, and a greater and other kind of thing, then any preſent providence can be; it will have more of terror in it then any preſent provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences can poſſibly have. There are abundance of excellent truths would flow from this Scripture; I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent my ſelf to collect four or five, which I conceive to be the eſpecial de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of our Lord Jeſus in theſe words, and that (through Grace) may be eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially uſeful to your ſouls.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Then from hence I would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to you this truth, that there are certain times and ſeaſons, in which dreadful things, ſad providences muſt inavoidably break in upon the world: this I gather thus, <hi>All theſe things that ſhall come to paſs:</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, There are ſad things, there are providences very grievous, ſuch as ſhall make the heart to ake, and trembling to poſſeſs the ſpirits of moſt men up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the face of the earth: yet ſaith he, they are ſuch as muſt come to paſs, if all the Angels in heaven ſtood up to prevent the breaking in of theſe provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences; there is an unavoidable neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of it, come they muſt.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:171179:7"/>
            <p n="2">2. I would note, that in and under theſe dreadful providences, the God of heaven is eſpecially thoughtful for, and careful about his own people; when he thruſts theſe providences into the world, I ſay the Lord is eſpecially thoughtful of and careful about his own people; this I ſuppoſe alſo to be fairly gathered from this Scripture, <hi>Watch ye and pray</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that you may eſcape theſe things:</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, My brethren, my poor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples with whom my heart is, and for whoſe weal and welfare, I am greatly ingaged; it is true, ſad things muſt be in the world, but I would take a little care of you, and ſtand by you, and be a help to you by what means I may, that you may ride ſafe in and through that ſtorm; and when the world ſhall be in a flame, and every corner of it full of trouble, I would that things might then go well with you, and your weal might go forward notwithſtanding: that is the ſecond.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But note this, that the eſcaping of common calamity, it is a great honor and great mercy, and that that graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hearts ought to put out earneſtly
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:171179:8"/> for. I gather this note thus, that it is a great honor, a great mercy, from that expreſſion, <hi>That ye may be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted worthy to eſcape;</hi> I tell you ſouls, thoſe that God thus in a way of mercy ſhelters and preſerves, and carries through days of evil and times of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon calamity, it is a mark of honor that God puts on them; and it is a mercy alſo that gracious ſouls ſhould make after, and put themſelves for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for the attaining of; that I gather thus, <hi>Watch ye and pray always,</hi> make out after this mercy, put out earneſtly for it: look not upon it as an indifferent thing, whether you eſcape or not, but look upon it as a mercy worth the ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after; that is a third thing that lyeth plainly in the words.</p>
            <p>Again 4. Note, that watchfulneſs and prayer are the neceſſary mediums, the proper means, at leaſt a part, and great part of the proper means, to which we are directed for preſervation in times of common calamity.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And then one thing more I would alſo recommend to you from theſe words, and that is this, that it is not the eſcaping common calamities only,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:171179:8"/> that we are to be ſolicitous about, but alſo, and above all, and more eſpecially, how we may after all <hi>ſtand before the Son of man,</hi> &amp;c. Alas my brethren, what if God ſhould ſatisfie and aſſure you or me, and tell you from heaven, you ſhall ſurvive, and out-live the diſtreſſes of your day; but yet when this is done, and you are paſt this ſtorm, you muſt ſtand before the judgement-ſeat of Chriſt, every ſoul muſt appear at that great Tribunal, from which there is no exemption by any means what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever: and the preſence and glory, the dread and majeſty of that day is more, and another kind of thing, then any diſpenſation upon earth can be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be; therefore how to hold up the head and ſtand with comfort at ſuch a time, is the great thing that we are eſpecially to be ſolicitous about, and that which our ſouls ſhould be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king out the hardeſt after.</p>
            <p>Now I confeſs the two latter of theſe notes will be moſt ſpi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>itual, and that that the ſoul and its concernments lye moſt in; and therefore I ſhall be much the ſhorter in the three former, though it is requiſite to ſpend ſometime
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:171179:9"/> on them, conſidering the diſpenſations of God at this day. I ſhall begin with with the firſt, and ſhall be brief in the ſpeaking unto it, <hi>viz.</hi> That ſome dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful providence mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> break in upon the world; there are times and ſeaſons when dreadful things muſt come upon the earth, ſuch as ſhall ſink the ſouls of many of the inhabitants of the earth: and there is a threefold reaſon of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe God hath ſpoken it, and he muſt not be a lyer; he is true, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what he hath ſaid muſt come to paſs. I tell you, though it were the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing up the foundations of the earth, or the moſt dreadful evil that the heart of man can imagine, if God have ſaid it, his word muſt ſtand; that muſt be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, rather then any reflection ſhould be upon the truth and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God; therefore ſaith our Lord Jeſus in <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.33. <hi>Heaven and earth ſhall paſs away, but my word ſhall not paſs away:</hi> God ſtands ſo much upon his word, that he will not give any on earth occaſion to reflect upon him as unfaithful and wanting in his truth; not the leaſt Iota or tittle of the Lords
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:171179:9"/> word ſhall fail, but ſhall be fulfilled to every letter of it; and therefore <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.18. it is thus written, <hi>I ſay to you, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntil heaven and earth paſs away, one jot or title ſhall in no wiſe paſs from the law, untill all be fulfilled.</hi> The Law is taken here in a comprehenſive ſence, for the whole book of Scripture; and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth ſhall paſs away, but not one title of the mind and will of God that he hath revealed, ſhall be made void, but ſhall ſtand and be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed: and it is ſufficiently bound and confirmed, in that the mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it. You ſhall find in Scripture that God ſtands greatly upon his word: what he ſpeaketh tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching a particular people or perſon, he will be ſure to accompliſh it, whether it be good or evil; and therefore in <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. it is ſaid of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he will command his children to keep the way of the Lord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that he may bring upon <hi>Abraham</hi> that which he hath ſpoken of him in <hi>verſe</hi> 19. as if he ſhould have ſaid, God hath ſpoken a great deal of good concerning <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham;</hi> now having ſpoken it, he muſt bring it to paſs. Truely God hath
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:171179:10"/> been wont to do ſo, he is accuſtomed to it, he is uſed to confirm his word unto his ſervants, and to do to them according to what word is gone out of his mouth; and therefore when diſcreet <hi>Abigail</hi> comes to plead with <hi>David</hi> that he ſhould not take revenge upon <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.30. ſhe tells him, that when the Lord ſhould have done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to all the good that he hath ſpoken concerning him, it ſhould then be a grief to him that he had ſhed blood cauſeleſly; ſhe concludes that God would do <hi>David</hi> good as he had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: And it is as if ſhe ſhould have ſaid, I know the word of God having gone forth, he will do good unto <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> according as he hath ſaid: And therefore you ſhall find <hi>David</hi> doth wonderfully rejoyce in a word from God; if God do but ſpeak it, <hi>David</hi> is comforted. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 60. <hi>David</hi> is in the beginning of the <hi>Pſalm</hi> under ſome kind of diffidence and diſtruſt, and a little diſcouraged; but in <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. <hi>God hath ſpoken</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in his holineſs, and I will rejoyce:</hi> Why, ſaith he, it is true, my condition is ſad; it was a time when <hi>David</hi> was in diſtreſs and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:171179:10"/> trouble: but now God hath ſpoken, and given me a word that it ſhall go wel with me; and in that I am ſatisfied, in that I can bear up my heart, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce. <hi>I will divide Sechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth: Judah is mine, &amp;c.</hi> ſo when God hath ſpoken a word to a people, he will make it good: hence is that of <hi>Balaam, Numb.</hi> 23.19. You know he was ſent to curſe <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but inſtead thereof he bleſſeth them, and ſpeaketh good to them; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did he do it? Why, ſaith he, God hath ſpoken good of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and that he will do; ſo that what God ſpeaketh, he ſtands upon his word to have it accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed. Secondly, when he ſpeaks e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil againſt a people, that muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed: God hath ſpoken evil a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Babylon, Jer.</hi> 51.62. <hi>verſe</hi> to the end, And what, muſt it be accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Yea it muſt; and as a ſign that what he had ſpoken ſhould be confirmed, <hi>It ſhall be,</hi> ſaith the Lord there, <hi>that when thou haſt made an end of reading this book, thou ſhalt binde a ſtone to it, and caſt it into the midſt of Euphrates;</hi> ſhe ſhall not riſe from the evil that I will bring upon her: I have not ſpoken evil
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:171179:11"/> onely, but I will bring evil upon her; and as a ſign for confirmation of this, the book was to be caſt into the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and ſo ſhould God caſt her down, that ſhe ſhould never riſe more. So take for confirmation of this, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. 24. God had threatned evil againſt <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> that the <hi>Caldeans</hi> ſhould come and fight againſt it, and take it; and what then? behold the mounts, they are come unto the City to take it, and that that God hath ſpoken is come to paſs, and thou ſeeſt it, thy eyes behold; the thing the Lord hath ſpoken and threatned, it is come to paſs: that is the firſt reaſon what God hath ſpoken muſt come to paſs, and God hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken dreadful things, that ſad judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhall break in upon the world, the vials of the wrath of God ſhall be poured forth, and in this Chapter he hath ſaid diſtreſs of Nations ſhall be; and having determined it, it ſhall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It muſt be to ſtain the pride of all glory (and ſo I ſuppoſe where that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion is, that I ſhall turn you to by and by, the Spirit of God intends) the ſtaining the pride of all glory is the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:171179:11"/> us ſee the vanity and emptyneſs of all the glory in the world, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we are apt to be taken with: now for the letting us ſee the emptineſs of it, the Lord muſt introduce ſad providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces upon the world, nothing elſe will do it: Alas, where the Goſpel of Chriſt is, God hath been preaching it a great while; we have been told of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of God, and of Communion with him, &amp; the excellency of ſpiritual things; but who is ſufficiently affected with their excellencies, and the emptineſs of the things of this world! and if this way will not do it, God will go another way to work, and will cauſe judgement to break in, and that will cauſe him that hath honor to ſee how little that is worth, and they that have the riches of this world, to ſee how little they are worth; the judgements of God knock off our fingers from theſe things, they open our eyes and poſſeſs us throughly with a ſence of the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all theſe things. That is a full Scripture that you have to this purpoſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 23.9. <hi>The Lord of hoſts hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it to ſtain the pride of all glory,</hi> &amp;c. Now for opening this Scripture, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:171179:12"/> letting you ſee how it is to my preſent purpoſe, give me leave to take up a little time, and I deſire you to conſider two things in this Text, that I may let you ſee how it is to my preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Conſider who are the honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that God will bring into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, By what means God will bring contempt upon them: and when I have done this, you will find that the judgements of God are Gods great ways and means to ſtain the pride of all glory.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Conſider, who this was ſpoken unto, it was to the City <hi>Tyre,</hi> the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of <hi>Tyre;</hi> well, and what was the glory of this City? There are divers things that were its glory.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all, it was a City, that was part of its glory; and ſo it is called once and again in this Chapter, as at <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. <hi>Is this your joyous City?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, It was a City in an Iſland, therefore of more then ordinary ſtrength, and ſome peculiar excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy it had upon that accompt; and that it was upon an Iſland, is plain from <hi>v.</hi> 2. <hi>Be

            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, It was an ancient City, ſo you ſee at <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. <hi>Is this your joyous City, whoſe antiquity is of ancient days?</hi> that was a part of its glory and honor; the antiquity of it could plead its Charter for a long time.</p>
            <p>Fou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>thly, A great trading City, that you have at <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. <hi>The harveſt of the River is her revenue, and ſhe is a mart of Nations,</hi> with which the Nations of the world come and trade, whither they come from all parts of the world: well, that is a fourth part of her glory.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, It was a very rich City, which is excellently expreſſed at <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. <hi>Who hath taken this counſel againſt the crowning City;</hi> mark the expreſſion by which it is called, The crowning City; the meaning of the expreſſion is this, <hi>Tyre</hi> it is ſuch a City that it crowns her Merchants, makes them Princes, rich and mighty ones in the world; her Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants are Princes, and her traffickers the honorable ones of the earth, as is
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:171179:13"/> after expreſſed; ſhe fills them with treaſure, and makes them admired in the world: now this was the glory that the Spirit of God here ſpeaks that he would ſtain, to be a City, a City in an Iſland, an ancient City, a great tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding City, and a rich crowning City; this was <hi>Tyres</hi> great glory, and yet this the Lord purpoſed to ſtain. But now 2. How will God do it? You will find it muſt be by judgement, <hi>Howl ye ſhips of Tarſhiſh, for it is laid waſte,</hi> verſ. 1. That is the way to ſhew men the emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs of the things of this world, and to bring them out of conceit with them; and therefore in <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. <hi>Who hath taken this counſel againſt Tyre,</hi> that is, of laying it waſte, who hath ſuch pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe? Oh, ſaith he in <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. <hi>The Lord hath purpoſed it:</hi> this little word <hi>It</hi> hath a ſtrong reference to the 8. and 1. <hi>verſ. Who hath taken this counſel,</hi> &amp;c. that is, the Lord hath done it, and <hi>who hath laid it waſte?</hi> it is the Lord hath done it, he hath purpoſed to bring judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to lay waſte, and ſo to ſtain the pride of their glory.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee that this Text is full to my purpoſe, that the judgements of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:171179:13"/> God are needful in order to the ſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the pride of the world. Thus alſo in the caſe of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> in <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. What was it that humbled the heart of that man? it was the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God did it; he comes in a proud ſpirit, more like a God then man, and in the pride of his heart he ſwells exceeding, <hi>Is not this great Babylon that I have built?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>verſ.</hi> 30. Well, but what courſe doth God take to humble him? Why in <hi>verſ.</hi> 31. while the word was in his mouth, he was took from men, and turned to graze among the beaſts; this was Gods way to ſtain the pride of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> to bring him down in a way of judgement, the like we never read or heard of; and you find when his ſeven years were accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, then he comes and adores God in a calm ſpirit, and gives glory to him; the man was cooled and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and it was this dreadful ſtroke upon him that did it. Take one Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture more, and that you have in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2. you may peruſe the whole Chapter, and you ſhall there ſee how the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God are deſigned to humble men, but particularly at <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. <hi>And
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:171179:14"/> the loftineſs of man ſhall be bowed down,</hi> &amp;c. Now how ſhall this be brought to paſs? look back to <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. and there he tells you, <hi>The day of the Lord of hoſts ſhall be upon every one that is proud and lofty,</hi> &amp;c. the day of the Lord of hoſts ſhall be upon him, that is, the day of Gods indignation, of his judgements, the day of his breaking forth in great diſpleaſure, that ſhall bring them down: We poor creatures, a little thing lifteth us up, but it muſt be a great thing muſt bring us down, it muſt be the day of the Lord of hoſts; he that commands the Armies of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth, he that commands the Armies of Angels, and ſends them out to do execution; he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands judgements: they are his hoſts, the creatures are his hoſts, and the Angels are his hoſts; he ſets the ſword to work, and the peſtilence to work; and by fighting againſt them with theſe hoſts, he humbles them, and brings them down, and layeth the heart of the haughty and lofty low; and ſo in the 19, 20, 21. <hi>verſes, They ſhall go into the holes of the rocks,</hi> &amp;c. What is it makes them do it? <hi>It is for fear of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:171179:14"/> the Lord, and for the glory of his majeſty, when he ariſeth to ſhake terribly the earth;</hi> then all men they throw away their Idols. Oh that we might all throw away our idols! have we m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>de the world, riches, honors, pleaſures, our idols? Oh it is time to throw them to the Owls and to the Bats; it is fit for them onely to live upon ſuch things as theſe are: when God comes forth thus in judgement, then they ſhall throw their idols to the Owls and to the Bats; and why ſo? it is becauſe they ſhall then be convinced of the vanity and emptineſs of theſe things. That is my ſecond reaſon why ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences muſt be, it is to ſtain the pride of all glory; God hath reſerved himſelf no other way to do it for ought we know, and the heart of man will not be brought down at any cheaper rate: Alas, the great men of the world they think they may do as they pleaſe, but when God comes thundering with his judgements, he makes them to tremble, and confeſs that they are but as other men.</p>
            <p>But then one reaſon more why ſuch ſuch things muſt come to paſs in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:171179:15"/> their time and ſeaſon, why it muſt be.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To vindicate Gods holineſs, that there may not be a reproach left upon the God of heaven, as if he were plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the ſin and wickedneſs of an evil generation. With reverence be it ſpoken, the God of heaven hath no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way to vindicate his holineſs, but by the execution of theſe judgements of his; I ſay that is the Lords way: do but mark how the wicked of the world do ſometimes challenge God to ſhew himſelf in his judgements, if he be a holy God; and therefore God is conſtrained to do it. In <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.17. <hi>You have wearyed God with your words, and wherein? even when you ſay every one that doth evil is good in the ſight of the Lord, or where is the God of judgement?</hi> Wicked men they ſay that God loves men that walk wickedly; and though we ſin, he loves us never the worſe: why if he do not love the workers of iniquity, where is the God of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? If our evil doings diſpleaſe him, why doth he not execute judgement? why doth be not let us ſee his diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure? God may ſay in his word what
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:171179:15"/> he will, wicked men will not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that; They better underſtand the language of his judgements, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if he be not the God of evil, and do hate all iniquity, why doth he not ſhew it by his judgements? Now I ſay God is put upon this, he is conſtrained to vindicate his own holineſs by his judgement: <hi>Becauſe ſentence againſt an evil-work is not executed ſpeedily, therefore the hearts of the ſons of men are fully ſet in them to do evil, Eccl.</hi> 8.11. The meaning of the Text is plainly this, becauſe wicked men are not puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in ways of ſin, ſay they, we may live as wickedly as we will, for ought we ſee, we ſhall fare as well as thoſe that are more preciſe: This is the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate wickedneſs of the heart, but God will make known himſelf by his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and thereby he will take off this reproach; and therefore that is a notable place <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 9.16. I think you have not this word <hi>Higgaion Selah</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove once more in the Scripture; this <hi>Higgaion</hi> doth import, Conſider, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate upon this: why what is it we ſhould take ſuch notice of? why it is this, <hi>The Lord is known by the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:171179:16"/> that he executes,</hi> that is, God is known by his judgements, in his holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in his purity, and it is that that ſets him forth in the glory of his attributes; when God brings judgement on the wicked, then they muſt confeſs that God is a holy God: and therefore take that Scripture more, where you have this confirmed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 58.9, 10. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your pots can feel the thornes;</hi> it is a metaphorical expreſſion, and I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the meaning is this, before the thornes or any other combuſtible mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter put under the pot can heat it, that is, in a very little time, God ſhall take away the wicked: what ſhall be the effect of this? <hi>The righteous ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce when he ſeeth the vengeance,</hi> and <hi>a man ſhall ſay, Verily there is a reward for the righteous, verily there is a God that judgeth in the earth:</hi> See what effect Gods judgements have, that a meer man that hath not any thing of grace in his ſoul, ſhall be forced to ſay that there is a reward for the righteous. They that ſay, Where is the God of judgement? when God comes forth in ways of judgement, he will make them change their note, and ſay, There is a
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:171179:16"/> God that doth righteouſly. Now here you have my reaſons why God will bring great judgements upon the world, having ſpoken it, as alſo to ſtain the pride of all fleſh, and laſtly to vindicate his own holineſs.</p>
            <p>Now we will try a little how this may be improved, what uſe we may make of it: truely I think it may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us of ſome ſuch things as theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If it be thus that diſmall provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences muſt come into the world, that God hath ſpoken of it, and given warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, then what a ſtupid ſottiſh thing is a carnal heart, that will not believe it untill he feels it! I ſay, ſuch is the ſtupidity of a carnal heart, that it will not believe it untill he feels it; this we find oft in Scripture, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 21. <hi>Theſe things thou haſt done</hi> (ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about a great many miſcarriages of wicked men) <hi>and I kept ſilence,</hi> ſaith God; and what then? thou thoughteſt that I liked all thy wickedneſs very well; but ſaith God, <hi>I will reprove thee, and ſet them in order before thee;</hi> I, and conſider it you that forget God! You do not think what I am, untill I come
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:171179:17"/> to tear you in pieces: conſider it you that forget God; conſider h s holineſs, his purity, his truth, his faithfulneſs in his threatning, for ſaith God, I am coming to tear you in pieces, I am coming with providences that will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken you: So 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.3, 4. This is the hardneſs, the ſottiſhneſs of wicked men, they are ſaying, <hi>Where is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of his coming?</hi> and who is the God of judgement? they would believe that all things continue as they were; they will not conſider it until the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God breaks forth among them. That is the firſt inference, what a ſtupid ſottiſh thing is a carnal heart.</p>
            <p>Again 2. It may inform us farther of the deſperate eſtate of ſinners that are not awakened with the judgements of God that are begun; ſuch there are in the world, that though God be come forth in a way of judgement, and have begun to do what he hath ſpoken, yet they do little conſider it. Indeed many ſinners before judgements are begun, do hope they will never begin, &amp; they feed themſelves much with ſuch fancies: much ſuch a people you read of in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.2. <hi>It is not near, let us
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:171179:17"/> build houſes,</hi> &amp;c. there were a people there, that the Prophet had threatned grievous things againſt. Well, what ſay they? why if theſe things ſhall come, they are a great way off; and though they come, it is not like that it will be in our days; and ſo hardened themſelves againſt the judgements; of the Lord that were to come upon them: So that <hi>Amos.</hi> 6.3. <hi>Ye put far away the evil day,</hi> and perſwade your ſelves that things are like to go well enough, and that judgements were a great way off, if they ſhould ever come; and therefore the Lord directs the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ophet in his meſſage, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 12.22. <hi>Son of man, what is that proverb?</hi> &amp;c. Uſually God did in Scripture give ſome time between threatning and execution, and what effect had this? Why the days are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed, ſay they, and every viſion fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: Judgements did not come pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, therefore they minded them not; and therefore ſaith God, <hi>I will cauſe this proverb to ceaſe; the days are at hand, and the effect of every viſion;</hi> judgement ſhall come: and yet ſuch is the ſecurity of mens hearts, they would firſt ſecure themſelves that judgements
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:171179:18"/> ſhould not begin; and when they are begun, they are not much minded: doubtleſs this is great carnal ſecurity, therefore <hi>Amos</hi> 3.8. <hi>The lion hath roared, who would not fear?</hi> I will at leaſt allude to it; when the Lion doth roar, when God is come out in the way of his judgements, who would not fear? it is a great evil to be of a ſtupid ſpirit under the judgements of God. I ſhall here a little, before I leave this head, ſhew firſt when ſouls are not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the judgements of God: And ſecondly, whence it is that they are not affected.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When ſouls are not affected with the judgements of God, it is when they do not hear and conſider what providences they lie under, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.11. <hi>When thy hand is lifted up they will not ſee;</hi> they go on in their own courſe, and do not ſo much as conſider that there is a fire kindled, and a fire that may burn very far, and do dreadful things.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Again ſecondly, The heart is not affected, when it doth not inquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ground of the controverſie: we are not onely to ſpeak of the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:171179:18"/> it ſelf, but we are to inquire into the ground of the controverſie: when <hi>Iſrael</hi> fled before the men of <hi>Ai, Joſhua</hi> he fell on his face to inquire what the matter was, what the ground of this controverſie was. How many are there in this great City that do not ſay, What have I done? wherefore doth God do this!</p>
            <p n="3">3. When men do not endeavour to ſet things right; when they do not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor to find out what is the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and having found it out, compoſe the breach that is between the Lord and his people, <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.6. <hi>I hearkened and heard, but they ſpake not aright: no man repented of his evil way, ſaying, What have I done?</hi> they ſpake not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right; why pray when do a people ſpeak aright in time of judgement? ſaith he, <hi>No man repented of his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> &amp;c. obſerve it: What is a right ſpirit in a day of judgement? It is to be ſaying, What have I done? to ſay, What hath the Nation done, is a duty, and What have others done, but eſpecially to ſay, What have I done? and wherein have I contributed to the evil of the day? Nay and this inquiring ſpirit is
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:171179:19"/> not all, but there muſt be a reforming ſpirit; he muſt turn from his courſe, and leave the trade of ſin that he was wont to drive; thus is it when we are not affected with the judgements of God. And whence is it? it is from ten cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. From ſecret hope it may go well with them: and I tell you, for the moſt part, wicked men are apt to think themſelves moſt ſecure: <hi>Amos</hi> 9.10. You read there of a ſtrange ſpirit; they were ſinners, a wicked people, and yet ſaith he, <hi>They ſay the evil ſhall not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take nor prevent us:</hi> but ſaith God, <hi>The ſinners of my people ſha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2. They do not conſider the dread that there is in the judgement of God: I found a poor ſoul ſpeaking of this judgement lately, ſaying, What ſhould we fear? we muſt all dye, and of what ſhould we be afraid? but I fear ſuch ſouls that can look upon things of ſuch moment ſo ſlightly, hardly know what dying means, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. <hi>Kiſs the Son, left he be angry, and ye periſh from the way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:171179:19"/> when his wrath is kindled but a little, bleſſed are all they that put their truſt in him;</hi> a little of the wrath of God is dreadful: God is very terrible in his judgements, though wicked men do not minde it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.3. <hi>Say unto the Lord, How terrible art thou in all thy works?</hi> In thy works of judgement how ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible art thou? the judgements of God would make men bow, but they do not conſider the dread of them, untill they are under them; the ſervants of God they do melt under them, and have a ſence of them, not a dread and fear that diſcompoſeth the ſoul, and puts it by its duty, but ſuch as is an awful ſence, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 52.5, 6. Obſerve what a mixture there is in the ſpirit of a Saint under Gods judgements: Gods judgements as they are revelations of his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, making good his threatnings, working out his glory; ſo the righteous laughs, but yet he fears too: There is a holy dread and awe upon his ſoul when he ſeeth how much of majeſty ſhines forth in them: Yea hypocrites are brought to fear becauſe of Gods judgements ſometimes; but now they that do not ſee what dread there is in
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:171179:20"/> them, they are not affected. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26. <hi>When the judgements of God are abroad in the earth, the inhabitants thereof ſhall learn righteouſneſs,</hi> that is, the good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the earth ſhall do ſo: mercy doth not any good to the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor will judgement, becauſe they mind not the majeſty of the Lord, therefore they are not affected: that is a ſecond inference.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If it be thus that ſad judgements muſt break in upon the world, then how miſerable will the wicked of the world be? Truly they fall under a double miſery; miſerable firſt, in that they ſhall have the greateſt part of preſent judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Secondly, In that they ſhall have an eternity of miſery hereafter. Miſerable in that they ſhall have the greater part of preſent judgement: Mind that <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.13, 14. <hi>Hear ye that are afar off what I have done, and you that are neer acknowledge my might: The ſinners in Sion are afraid,</hi> &amp;c. mark, as if he ſhould ſay, Men at length begin to conſider: Oh preſent judgements are ſad, <hi>You that are near acknowledge my might:</hi> you ſee much of terror is in preſent judgements; but if ſuch be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:171179:20"/> what will an after-judgement be? what will devouring fire be? therefore take heed where your lot is caſt, and among what ſort of men you are.</p>
            <p n="4">4. What ſhould ſinners do? will ſuch judgements break in upon the world? what ſhould ſinners do? they ſhould come and ſubmit to Chriſt. Be any of you ſinners? I tell you dreadful things will be upon the world; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be now begun or no, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell you; but ſuch there ſhall be; and what will you do? your work is to come and cloſe with Chriſt; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Pſalm</hi> is worth your reading an hundred times over, he tells you what he will do with the wicked, he will break them in pieces, he will ſcatter them; Well, what then? Oh, <hi>Kiſs the Son, leſt he be angry,</hi> come bow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him (for that kiſs is a kiſs of ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction) it is a dreadful thing to meet with an angry Chriſt: He is a Lamb, and he is a Lion; he is a Lamb ſlain, and come but and kiſs him, and he will be a Lamb ſlain to you; if not, he will be the Lion of the tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> to tear you in pieces. <hi>Now knowing,</hi> ſaith the

Take the ſence of this text, and you ſhall ſee it much to my purpoſe: God was coming forth in dreadful judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but the wicked of the world they think to ſecure themſelves: How? <hi>When the over-flowing ſcourge ſhall paſs over, it ſhall not come nigh to us:</hi> Why not? why, <hi>We have compounded with death, and with hell are we at agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> I but ſaith the Spirit of God, take a little of my advice; do not give truſt and confidence to your own ways, <hi>But,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I have laid in Sion a chief corner-ſtone,</hi> and truſt to that: this is the meaning of it; do not talk of your agreeing with Death, and compounding with hell, but to go to Chriſt, to the foundation that I have ſet and laid for you to build upon for your ſafety &amp; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity. Will you ask your heart how it is with you? Have you built on this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation-ſtone? if you have, that is the

            <p n="6">6. If God be coming forth in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſuch terrible ones too, how good is it to be a Saint, and to be found
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:171179:22"/> in a right ſpirit in the day when God contends and comes out with his indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation againſt the world? I tell thee, if thou art a Saint, and that in a right ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, it will be well with thee in the day that God contends. And thus I have diſpatched the firſt Doctrine, namely, that dreadful providences muſt come upon the world: and having done with this, I paſs on to the ſecond note from the words,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Namely, that when God doth come forth with theſe dreadful diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, he is eſpecially thoughtful for and careful about the weal and welfare of his own people. He doth not hurl his judgements into the world at all adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, careleſly and inconſiderately, not caring where they light; but his eye is much upon, and his care much after his own people: He hath a great reſpect to them in all that he doth in the world.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In proſecution of this truth, I ſhall firſt confirm it to you, that in publike calamities, God is very mindful of his people, and his heart is much to them.</p>
            <pb n="35" facs="tcp:171179:22"/>
            <p>And 2. Give you the Reaſons of it, and then make a little Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>But firſt of all, for confirmation of the truth, it is evident from two or three things, that the Lord doth take a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all care of his people in days and times of common calamity: It is evident from what he hath done in ſuch ſeaſons in times paſt; you ſhall ſcarce find a common calamity recorded in the book of God, but you ſhall find ſome care taken of his people: therefore though there is a true ſence in that word, that <hi>all things come alike to all,</hi> I ſay a ſence that hath a truth in it, yet this is alſo true, that God hath a care of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in all the common calamities that ever come upon the world: Thus it it was when God came to ſweep away a whole world, was there none to be thought of? no body to be remembred? yes, there was a <hi>Noah</hi> that God could not forget, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.13, 14. <hi>Noah</hi> might ſay, What, the end of all fleſh? what ſhall become of me then? what ſhall I do when all fleſh is deſtroyed? Why, ſaith God, <hi>Noah,</hi> make thee an A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>k, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. I will not ſo deſtroy all fleſh, but I
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:171179:23"/> will remember thee <hi>Noah,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore make thee an Ark; and ſaith God to him in <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. <hi>With thee I will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh my covenant, and thou ſhalt come into the ark, thou and thy ſons, and thy ſons wives with thee.</hi> Thus it was in the deſtruction of <hi>Sodom,</hi> God came with reſolution to deſtroy that place, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.12, 13. Great provocations call for great deſolation; dreadful judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are the neceſſary conſequents of great preceding iniquities: but <hi>Lot</hi> he muſt be taken care of, and a ſhelter and refuge muſt be provided for him. Thus in the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> when the Lord ſent his Plagues amongſt them, ye this very judgement of the Plague I believe that was the judgement, and I will give you a Scripture to prove it; the threatning was, he would deſtroy all the firſt-born of <hi>Pharoah, Exod.</hi> 11.5, 6, 7. Now the queſtion is what judgement it was that he did deſtroy the firſt-born of <hi>Egypt</hi> by; I think it was the Plague, and that that confirms me in my thoughts of it, is that <hi>Amos</hi> 4.10. where he ſaith, <hi>I have ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you the Peſtilence after the manner of Egypt:</hi> Now I do not know any
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:171179:23"/> time when God did ſend the Peſtilence into <hi>Egypt,</hi> unleſs when he deſtroyed the firſt-born; and yet at that time when he did deſtroy the firſt-born of all the houſe of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the Lord took care of his people, <hi>Iſrael</hi> muſt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, not a dog muſt move the tongue againſt any of them. <hi>Gen.</hi> 42. when there was a famine in <hi>Canaan,</hi> yea a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine in all lands, and a great ſcarcity grew over the face of the Land of <hi>Egypt;</hi> yet <hi>Jacob</hi> and his children muſt be provided for, and God muſt look after them, and he bids them go down to <hi>Egypt;</hi> and you find how they were there fed; God had by a ſignal providence ſent <hi>Joſeph</hi> before hand, as he ſaith himſelf, to ſave <hi>Jacob</hi> and his family alive. <hi>Jeremiah</hi> in the time of captivity, and great deſtruction, what muſt become of him? muſt he periſh with the reſt? No, ſaith God, I will deliver thee in that day, <hi>Jer.</hi> 39.17, 18.</p>
            <p>Now this is my firſt argument to confirm this general truth, that in times of common calamity, God takes an eſpecial care of his people, as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from what he hath done.</p>
            <pb n="38" facs="tcp:171179:24"/>
            <p n="2">2. From the promiſe of what he will do; he makes ſpecial promiſes to his people of what he will do in ſuch ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:171179:24"/> into your chambers, and ſhut the doors about you, hide your ſelf for a little mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, untill mine indignation be over-paſt.</hi> I am coming to puniſh the world for their iniquity; but my people I have a word for your comfort, I will find retiring Chambers for you; <hi>Hide your ſelf,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>for a little moment, untill mine indignation be over-paſſed:</hi> So <hi>Joel.</hi> 3.16. <hi>He ſhall roar out of Sion,</hi> &amp;c. the Lord will work for his people, and do his people good; he will be the hope of his people, and the ſtrength of the children of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> Therefore this is my ſecond argument, God makes ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial promiſes to his people, therefore, he will take ſpecial care of them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He gives ſpecial counſel and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to them what to do in order to their preſervation in times of common calamity.</p>
            <p>There are three parts of counſel that the Lord gives to his people in ſuch ſeaſons, and he directs them ſometimes to one of theſe things, and ſometimes to another, according as he thinks good in himſelf; ſometimes he calls his people out of the places that ſhall be the ſeats of his judgements: he did
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:171179:25"/> ſo in the caſe of <hi>Sodom:</hi> and it is worth your conſidering that you have <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.20, 21. <hi>When you ſhall ſee Jeruſalem compaſſed with Armies, know the deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof is nigh;</hi> that ſhall be a ſign to you, that I am coming againſt it with a deſolating judgement: Well, what then muſt be done? <hi>Let them that are in Judah flye to the mountain, and let them that are in the City depart out, and let not them that are in the Countries en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thereinto.</hi> This was his counſel at that time; and thus God doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times: he calleth ſome out of the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by the method of his providence, he tells them his will, and brings them out of the ſeat of his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He calls all in all times in, order to preſervation, from cloſing with and cleaving to the ſins of the places which are to be judged, and for which he judgeth and condemneth; that one known Text may ſerve in ſtead of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.4. <hi>Come out of her my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le</hi> (that is, out of <hi>Babylon) and be ye ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate, partake not of her ſins, leſt ye alſo partake of her plagues;</hi> ſin as ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners do, and you muſt expect to ſuffer as they do.</p>
            <pb n="41" facs="tcp:171179:25"/>
            <p n="3">3. He doth direct his people to ſome ſpecial duties that have an eſpecial ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to preſervation, ſometimes to faith, to truſt in, and dependance upon the Lord; and ſometimes to prayer and watchfulneſs, as here in my Text: to ſome ſuch ſpecial duties, that have an eſpecial uſe in order to the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a people from deſtroying and ruining calamities. Thus, I ſay, put theſe things together, what God hath done, what he hath promiſed to do, what counſel he gives unto his people, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to common calamities, they are evident tokens of love to his people in times of diſtreſſe: But now what is the reaſon? wherefore is it that God ſhould eſpecially be careful of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in days of great diſtreſs and trouble? I anſwer, he doth it for two or three reaſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the love he bears them, and the intereſt that he hath in them; he hath an intereſt in his people, they are neer unto him in a neer relation, and he hath great love to them; therefore it is he eſpecially bears an eye to his people, and looks after them, that things may go well with them in the days of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:171179:26"/> evil; ſome Scriptures you have to this purpoſe: That <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.10, 11. <hi>Fear not, O my ſervant Jacob,</hi> &amp;c. though, ſaith God, I make a full end of other Nations and people, I will ſave thee. Truely one might have replyed to the Lord as <hi>Judas</hi> did (not <hi>Iſcariot</hi>) And why us Lord, and why not the world? Becauſe thou art <hi>Jacob</hi> my ſervant, thou art <hi>Iſrael</hi> a people that I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in, therefore I will look after thee, and ſhew kindneſs unto thee; I will do it for that reaſon: and add to this, that <hi>Jer.</hi> 43.4. Obſerve here, <hi>I will give men for thee, and people for thy life.</hi> What is the meaning of that? I will let my wrath and rage vent it ſelf upon the world, but I will ſpare my people: Why ſo? I have loved them, therefore I will give men for them; hundreds of men God will give for his people, they are neer the heart of God, therefore he is pleaſed to exerciſe this peculiar kindneſs to them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He doth it becauſe of the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and worth that is in them; not that a Saint by nature is better then others, but through grace he is become a choice and precious one; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:171179:26"/> of the worth, choiceneſs, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of a gracious ſoul, God loves him: The Saint is an excellent piece; The righteous is more excellent then his neighbor: It may be the righteous man is in a poor low condition in the world, &amp; his neighbor a great rich man, abounding in the things of this world, and yet for all that the righteous is more excellent then his neighbor. God hath a great care of his people, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are precious, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.4. <hi>Since thou waſt precious in my ſight, thou haſt been honorable, and I have loved thee;</hi> therefore others ſhall dye, and thou ſhalt be ſaved: Why? namely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou art precious in my ſight, I ſee a worth in thee, and an excellency in thee, and therefore others ſhall go for thee; they ſhall periſh, but thou ſhalt be preſerved. In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.15. <hi>David</hi> hath an expreſſion to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, <hi>Precious in the ſight of the Lord is the Death of his Saints;</hi> and the <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt</hi> gives this as a reaſon why the Lord did preſerve him when time was, ſaith he, <hi>Precious in the ſight of the Lord is the death of his Saints. Pſal.</hi> 72.14. You have a Scripture ſomething of like
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:171179:27"/> nature, Precious ſhall their blood be in his ſight.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But one reaſon more, Why the Lord in common calamities is eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly careful of his people, it is becauſe they truſt God with themſelves, they charge God with them, and God will be faithful to his charge; he will not betray his truſt, he is the hope of his people. So <hi>Jer.</hi> 14.8. <hi>Oh thou the hope of Iſrael, the Saviour thereof in the time of trouble:</hi> So <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.16, 17. <hi>As for me, I have not haſtened from being a Paſtor to follow thee, nor have I deſired the woful day; be not a terror unto me, Thou art my hope in the day of evil:</hi> Oh ſaith the Lord, think upon me, I deſire to be faithful unto thee, to mind thee in thy work, and follow thee in thy way; and I have not deſired the evil day, thou knoweſt, that that came out of my lips was right before thee, and thou are my hope: Mind it, this was the reaſon why God did give <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah</hi> a ſpecial preſervation; it was becauſe he made the Lord his truſt, <hi>Jer.</hi> 39.18. <hi>For I will ſurely deliver thee,</hi> &amp;c. thou haſt committed the keeping thy ſelf unto me, therefore I will be
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:171179:27"/> good to thee, and I will preſerve thee. It is worth the thinking of, that the Lord doth it becauſe his people t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uſt in him. Thus much for confirmation of the point, and the Reaſons of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But you will ſay, If this be a truth, this may be objected, <hi>If the Lord chuſe to have a particular reſpect unto his people in times of common calamity, how comes it to paſs that any of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould fall in ſuch a diſpenſation, as we ſometimes ſee they do?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To that I anſwer, There are theſe reaſons why, notwithſtanding Gods ſpecial care of his people in common calamities, ſom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of them do fall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: it is for one or more of theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons uſually.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is ſometimes through unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; God keeps them while they truſt him, but when their truſt fails, then the promiſe fails, and God is not a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity to them: it is ſometimes through unbelief; ſo we find it in the caſe of <hi>Iſraels</hi> going to <hi>Canaan;</hi> there were abundance fell in the wilderneſs, and truely among thoſe that fell we may think there were ſome upright ones that had grace in their hearts, but
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:171179:28"/> yet they diſtruſted God, they thought the journey was long and tedious, and the way was difficult, therefore they fell in the wilderneſs, it was becauſe of their unbelief: <hi>By whom was he grieved fourty years in the wilderneſs? Was it not by them whoſe carcaſes fell in the wilderneſs? To whom he ſware in his wrath that they ſhould not enter into his reſt,</hi> Heb. 3.17, 18, 19. And why en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered they not? becauſe of unbelief: So it is in this caſe, God makes ſpecial promiſes of preſervation; but when the faith of his people failes, ſometimes God ſuffers them to loſe the fruit of the promiſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When his people ſin as the world doth, then he cauſeth them to taſte of judgement with the world; when they keep not clear from the ſin for which God contends, he ſuffers them to fall in and by the judgements wherewith he contends: So in that of the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, Partake not of her ſins, leſt you partake of her plagues:</hi> in which words you have a promiſe and a threatning; promiſe, if you do not partake of her ſin, then you ſhall not ſuffer with her; but if you do, you may expect to ſhare
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:171179:28"/> with her in judgement: and therefore you find <hi>Moſes</hi> a choice ſervant, and he ſuffered in the wilderneſs as well as the reſt; and it was becauſe he ſinned as they did that dyed in the wilderneſs, <hi>Numb.</hi> 27.12. Why might he not go into <hi>Canaan?</hi> VVhy, ſaith he, <hi>For ye rebelled againſt my commandment in the deſert of Zin,</hi> &amp;c. You rebelled when the Congregation rebelled, and therefore for that reaſon, although it was the one time that <hi>Moſes</hi> did miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry in his way towards <hi>Canaan,</hi> and yet for joyning with the people in that one ſin of murmuring, he was cut ſhort of <hi>Canaan:</hi> and ſo it is in caſes of common calamity, if we ſin with the world, we may be led to ſuffer with the world. Therefore by the way, make this your care, Touch not with the abominations of the Day in which you live, for which you may conclude God contends; rather ſuffer any thing in the world, then put your ſelf under the ſtroke of God, by doing any thing againſt him; and ſay not it is a little ſin, becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> ſinning but once with the people, he fell with them in the wilderneſs.</p>
            <pb n="48" facs="tcp:171179:29"/>
            <p n="3">3. It is ſometimes for want of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king uſe of the means that the Lord hath appointed for preſervation. It is not good to ſin againſt the uſe of means: God doth great things, but he doth uſe to tye us to the uſe of means: <hi>Naaman</hi> he came to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, and the Prophet bids him go to <hi>Jordan,</hi> and waſh ſeven times, and he ſhould be whole. Now he was vexed at this, and why would not other waters do as well? but his ſervants incouraged him to uſe the means the Prophet had preſcribed; and if he had not, he might have gone a Le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>par to his grave. So Chriſt he takes clay and ſpittle, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noints the eyes of the blind man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and bids him go waſh in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Siloam,</hi> and he ſhould receive his ſight: Now the neglect of the means the Lord is pleaſed to provide for us, is enough to make us fall by the publike and common ſtroke. The children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as you read, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.25. When <hi>Moſes</hi> was full fourty years old, he ſuppoſed that they would have underſtood he was to have been their Saviour, and that they would have taken hold of him for their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:171179:29"/> at that time; but they did not ſee the means propoſed, and did not make uſe of it, and what followed? you ſhall find it was fourty years after before he returned unto them again, as you may ſee at <hi>verſ.</hi> 30. This is plain, that <hi>Moſes</hi> did offer himſelf to them at that time, as a deliverer appointed by God, but they not ſee it, and make uſe of it, and therefore they continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their bondage fourty years more. I quote this, to tell you that you ought to look up unto the Lord for what means he doth allow, for the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of that mercy that we wait for, and by his providence he ſeems to point out to us: That the neglect hereof may be the occaſion of our fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
            <p n="4">4. God doth ſometimes ſuffer Saints to fall by common ſtrokes, to prevent ſome greater evils, as you have it <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. <hi>The righteous periſheth and no man lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it to heart, and merciful men are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, none conſidering that they are taken away from the evil to come.</hi> Truely God ſometimes takes away his people in the beginning of a calamity, and that becauſe there are more dreadful
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:171179:30"/> things behind; and that becauſe he would preſerve them from that evil, he is pleaſed to ſuffer them to fall.</p>
            <p>And theſe may ſerve as an account why notwithſtanding Gods peculiar and ſingular care of his people, he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers ſometimes ſome of them to fall in and by publike calamities.</p>
            <p>And thus I have diſpatched the Doctrinal part of this truth, and I ſhall conclude what I have more to ſay to it in a little Application.</p>
            <p>Is this true, that God doth in a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar way in times of publick calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty look after his people?</p>
            <p n="1">1. Surely then it ſhould ſtir up all that have any mercy of this kind, to give the Lord the glory of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſpeak good of his name, that he is pleaſed thus to bear a hand upon his own people.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Lord taking this care for his people, you ought to ſerve him in the making uſe of any thing that he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes you in order to ſelf-preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to wait upon the Lord in watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and prayer, and whatever means he doth direct you unto, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to preſervation: As the life of a
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:171179:30"/> Saint is precious in his eyes, ſo ſhould it be in yours, and whatever God looks upon as a mercy worth the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing, you ſhould look upon as worth the receiving: Ah ſouls! let me tell you, the judgements of God they are no ſlight things, but things that carry a great deal of dread along with them, and it is eminent kindneſs (as I hope to ſhew you hereafter) to be ſafe guarded at ſuch times and under ſuch providences.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If it be thus, that God in calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty takes a ſingular care of his people, you alſo ſhould take ſingular care to glorifie God, and anſwer his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and deſigne in and under com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon calamities: Ever mark this, in whatever thing God ſhews kindneſs unto his people, they alſo ſtand much ingaged to ſhew kindneſs unto God, as I may with reverence phraſe it, that is, that they be careful to honor him. But you will ſay, How are we to carry it in ſuch a day?</p>
            <p>Why for anſwer, Firſt of all ſtudy the judgement well; when the hand of God is abroad, do not ſlight it, do not make light of it, but ſee that it is
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:171179:31"/> Gods hand, and his hand in a more then ordinary way; labor to ſee and be affected with that majeſty that ſhines forth in it: <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>My fleſh trembles for fear of thee, and I am afraid of all thy judgements,</hi> Pſal. 119.120. He did not look upon the judgements of God with a ſlight ſpirit, but did ſee much of the glory of God ſhining therein.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You are much to ſtudy your own hearts; ſuch dealings of God without you, do call upon you to be looking within you, to be conſidering the frame of your ſouls; it calls upon you loudly to be finding out the plague of your own heart, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.38. Every man is to ſtudy his own heart, to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor to know that, and ſee the ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, vileneſs, and wretchedneſs of that. I tell you ſouls, the judgements of God that are abroad are not things of an empty ſound, but they do ſpeak power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and plainly, and are loud calls of God unto you, that you ſhould make it your buſineſs and the deſign of your ſouls to be more acquainted with your ſelves then ever.</p>
            <pb n="53" facs="tcp:171179:31"/>
            <p n="3">3. He calls to you to mourn over your own and others abominations, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9.4. The ſpirit of God ſpeaks of them that mourn, ſigh and weep, for the abominations of the wicked; that is it that the God of heaven calls for at your hands.</p>
            <p>And then laſtly, if this be a truth, that the Lord bears a ſpecial eye of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to his people in the day of their calamity, then let every ſoul of you paſs into the number of Saints.</p>
            <p>There are three ſorts of perſons in the world, and but one of the three that can promiſe themſelves ſafety in a day of evil. 1. Openly prophane. 2. Secret hypocrites; And 3. real Saints: and of the three, it is but the latter ſort that can promiſe themſelves any ſecurity.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Of the openly prophane, what ſhall come of them? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Wo to the wicked, it ſhall go ill with them, for the reward of their hands ſhall be given them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. As for the ſecret hypocrites, what ſhall become of them? things ſhall go ill enough with them alſo, as you have it in the prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah, The ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:171179:32"/> in Sion are afraid, and fear hath ſurpriſed the hypocrite, and who can dwell in everlaſting burnings?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But 3. The Saints they are the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that ſhall have the eſpecial kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God over them; they are the people that God will look after; and therefore I recommend this to you, to make it your buſineſs to ſee that there be ſomething of God in you in truth, and that you may be found in a ſpirit ſuiting the providences of this day, and then the Lord may make you par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of this ſpecial mercy of being preſerved in the time of common cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>
            <p>Which leads me to the third Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, namely, That it is a great honor and an eſpecial mercy, and that that Saints ſhould put out earneſtly for, to be preſerved and kept in times of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon calamity.</p>
            <p>In treating of which, I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour diſtinctly to confirm theſe three things. 1. That it is a great honor. 2. A great mercy. 3. That the Saints ſhould put out hard for preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in a time of common cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>
            <pb n="55" facs="tcp:171179:32"/>
            <p>For the firſt therefore, that it is a great honor to be preſerved, when God cometh forth with deſolating judgement: Methinks that Scripture carrieth much of weight in it, that you have <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.8. <hi>But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord:</hi> What is that? <hi>Noah</hi> found favour in the eyes of God; that is, he was a man that became a favorite of God; he was one honored in the Court of heaven. It is the known ſignification of the term in our common language, ſuch a one finds grace in the ſight of his Prince, that is, he is his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite, and he is honored by him: So <hi>Noah</hi> he was one that God put an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor upon; and what was the honor? it was to make him a preſerved one in the time of that common calamity. It may appear if we conſider three things, that it is a great honor to be preſerved in a deſolating calamity.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If you conſider this, That uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch as the Lord preſerves, they are ſuch upon whom there are ſome marks of honor found, or (mind what I add more) if any other be preſerved, it is for the ſake of them upon whom ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is found very honorable and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:171179:33"/> worthy. I ſhall clear up this from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inſtances, that there is ſome excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent thing found in and upon thoſe whom the Lord uſually preſerves in a deſolating judgement; and my firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is that of <hi>Noah,</hi> and you ſhall find ſomething in him very honorable and commendable: <hi>Noah</hi> found favor with God, and what was the reaſon that he ſhould be marked by God for this ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial favour? If you look <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.9. you ſhall find that <hi>Noah</hi> was a juſt man and perfect in his generation, and he walked with God: You muſt bear with me if I take up a little time in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting upon this, that I may ſhew you the deſign I have herein.</p>
            <p>There were three excellent things found upon <hi>Noah,</hi> upon which account God marked him out for the man <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat ſhould be preſerved from this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He was a juſt man, an upright, ſincere, ſingle-hearted man; he was a man that did in the truth of his ſoul follow God, which is an admirable thing: Hypocriſie and guile is one of the moſt diſhonorable things under heaven; I tell you ſouls, a hypocritical
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:171179:33"/> profeſſor is worſe then a downright ſinner, and ſo the Lord himſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.6. <hi>Thou deſireſt truth in the inward part, and in the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den part thou ſhalt make me to u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand wiſdom;</hi> thou art, ſaith <hi>David,</hi> for ſimplicity, for ſincerity and integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; that is a thing that takes much with the heart of God. Hypocriſie is one of the worſt things, and hath one of the ſaddeſt iſſues and conſequences in the world, and therefore hypocrites they are ſaid to heap up wrath, in <hi>Job</hi> 36.13. <hi>Hypocrites in heart they heap up wrath:</hi> This jugling and falſe-hearted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is a moſt diſpleaſing thing to God, and is of moſt wretched conſequence, for they ſhall not onely fall under wrath, but under heaps of wrath, that are found in this frame; they ſhall have the indignation of God heaped upon them: now I conclude on the other hand, ſincerity is a thing of great worth, and this was found upon <hi>Noah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. He was a perfect man in his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration; that is thus, he was perfect in the ſight of men among whom he lived and converſed; he was ſuch, and ſo walked, that none about him could
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:171179:34"/> tell how to accuſe him; he was a man that gave them no juſt offence, nor laid a ſtone of ſtumbling before thoſe that lived about him: the world (as wicked as it was) could not ſay that he gave them any ill example, but he was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in that wicked world; now this is a very honorable thing: I tell you many profeſſors do profeſſion more hurt then good, and it were well they were out of it, for they carry it ſo wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly and baſely, that they harden the hearts of ſinners, and make them think ill of the ways of God: but it is an excellent thing ſo to carry it, that they may be good examples: is not this Chriſts command? <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine, as that others ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your good works, may glorifie your Father which is in heaven:</hi> carry it ſo in the world, as that you may incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage all, and diſcourage none, that is the meaning of it, that you may not be a hinderance unto any in their cloſing with and giving up themſelves unto God. <hi>Paul</hi> that ſervant of the Lord injoyned the ſame thing, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.32. <hi>Give none offence neither to Jew nor Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, nor to the Church of God;</hi> carry
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:171179:34"/> it ſo, that you may not juſtly caſt a ſtone of ſtumbling in their way; this was found in <hi>Noah,</hi> and was a thing very honorable in him, and it is commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in others in that <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. and the beginning: it was the commendation of <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> that they wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in all the commandments of the Lord blameleſs, as you have it in <hi>ver.</hi> 6. Obſerve what is commended in theſe two perſons, what marks of honor were upon them, they were righteous before God; a righteouſneſs they had, that was ſo in Gods account; and in their walking before men they were blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, as to commandments and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. Mark this text, there is a great fault in many in the world; two ſorts of people eſpecially are to blame by vertue of this Text: ſome walk in commandments, but are not for ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; and ſome in ordinances, and not in commandments: whereas it is the glory of a people to walk both in commandments and in ordinances: my meaning is, the carrying of it ſo in the worſhip of God, and in your converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions alſo among men, that they may not have juſt occaſion of offence. Now
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:171179:35"/> this was found upon <hi>Noah,</hi> he was juſt in his generation.</p>
            <p>And the other thing is this, <hi>And Noah walked with God,</hi> that is the third honorable character upon <hi>Noah, He walked with God:</hi> What is th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t? true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I think walking with God is the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving friendſhip and acquaintance with God: Can two walk together unleſs they be agreed? ſaith <hi>Amos,</hi> 3.3. <hi>Noah</hi> he had friendſhip and acquaintance with God, and therefore he could walk with him, he could keep company with him: in walking together we have the company of one another; this had <hi>Noah,</hi> he was in Gods way, he kept in his way. Alſo the having and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining peace and communion with God, is intended in this walking with God. We are apt to account it a great happineſs to have friendſhip with great men; ſurely it is much more and a great deal better to have communion with the God of heaven; to have it and keep it, is the great glory of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. This <hi>Noah</hi> had, and it was greatly his honor: Saith 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.3. <hi>Our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip is with the Father and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> as if he ſhould have
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:171179:35"/> ſaid, Brethren, we are a people intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in choice and excellent mercies, and we would invite you to a part in them; but pray what is this choice mercy? Why it is this, <hi>We have fellowſhip with the Father through his Son Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> A great honor to the ſouls that have it; and theſe were the honorable marks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this <hi>Noah.</hi> Now he was the man that God pickt out to deliver and keep in this common calamity when all the world was drowned, he and thoſe that went upon his ſcore (for his family was taken in upon this account) they muſt be preſerved: and that is my firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
            <p>My ſecond is the inſtance of <hi>Lot,</hi> a man preſerved in a common calamity, and a few others for his ſake: Well, was there any honorable Character found upon him? Yes, there was, look 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 7. <hi>He delivered juſt Lot vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the filthy converſation of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.</hi> Here is the honorable Character found upon <hi>Lot:</hi> He was juſt <hi>Lot,</hi> and <hi>juſt Lot vexed with the filthy converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the wicked:</hi> I ſhall onely a little inſiſt upon that clauſe, <hi>Vexed with the filthy converſation of the wicked.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="62" facs="tcp:171179:36"/>
            <p>The ſin of the world was a burthen to his ſoul, and that that he could hardly bear up under: You ſhall find that is an excellent frame, and that that God is pleaſed much to honor: ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 139.21. <hi>Do I not hate them that hate thee? and am I not grieved with them that riſe up againſt thee?</hi> Oh, ſaith he, Lord, thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt my heart, and thou knoweſt that there is ſomething in me that thou prizeſt, that is his meaning; now what is it? Why, ſaith he, they that grieve God, they grieve me too; they that carry it ſo as that they are a burthen to the Spirit of Grace, they are alſo a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then to my ſpirit, I cannot bear it: And hence he cryeth out in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 120. 5. <hi>Wo is me that I ſo journ in Meſech, that I dwell in the tents of Kedar;</hi> that is, that I dwell among a wicked ungodly people, a people whereby God is greatly diſhonored; wo is me that my lot is caſt among ſuch a people: This was the honorable character found up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Lot,</hi> he was grieved with the filthy converſation of the wicked, therefore God markes him out, and would not ſuffer him to fall by that judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <pb n="63" facs="tcp:171179:36"/>
            <p>My next inſtance is, that of <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> upon them were alſo ſome marks of honor, upon <hi>Caleb</hi> eſpecially, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.24. <hi>But my ſervant Caleb, becauſe he had another ſpirit, and hath followed me fully,</hi> &amp;c. Here was <hi>Calebs</hi> mercy, his going into <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the honor put upon him, was his not fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the wilderneſs among the many thouſands that fell, but he muſt go into the good land.</p>
            <p>His honorable characters were theſe two. Firſt, he was a man of another ſpirit. Secondly, He had followed God fully.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He was a man of another ſpirit, of a more excellent ſpirit then the reſt of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> I, let me tell you, a man of a more excellent ſpirit then ſome of the worthies of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> To have ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of ſpirit, is one of the moſt excellent things in the world; a man is truely excellent according to the excellence of his ſpirit, and that was found upon <hi>Caleb. Moſes</hi> was a man of a very good ſpirit, yet (it ſeems) <hi>Caleb</hi> was of a more excellent ſpirit then he. I ſay, <hi>Moſes</hi> was a man of a very good ſpirit, <hi>Num.</hi> 12.3. <hi>Now the man Moſes
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:171179:37"/> was very meek above all the men on the face of the earth;</hi> he had great meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſpirit, which is one of the moſt excellent ſpirits in the world: See what teſtimony God gives of ſuch in that 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.4. <hi>The ornament of a meek and quiet ſpirit, which is in the ſight of God of great price.</hi> Now, I ſay, <hi>Moſes</hi> he had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>it then he; for <hi>Moſes</hi> dyeth in the wilderneſs and <hi>Caleb</hi> is carryed unto <hi>Canaan:</hi> that was one of the marks upon him, he was a man of a more excellent ſpirit: And the other was, he followed God fully. What is the meaning of that? It is this, he he was for all ſorts of work, eaſie and hard, and all together, never made a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty where God made none; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God called him to, that he was for. You ſhall find wherein he did diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his following of God fully, <hi>Num.</hi> 13.31. When the bad ſpies came and brought an ill report on the good land, and cryed there are great difficulties, we ſhall never be able to encounter with them: Now <hi>Caleb</hi> he diſcovers his excellency, and ſhews that he was

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:171179:38"/> preſerves none in ſuch a ſeaſon, but thoſe upon whom there is ſomething of excellence to be found; or if others, it is for the ſake of thoſe upon whom thoſe honourable Characters are found.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is a great honor to be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from common calamity, if you conſider, that thoſe that he doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve are uſually ſuch as he doth mean to honor with himſelf for ever; or if he do honor others with this mercy, it is for the ſake of thoſe that he intends to honor with himſelf for ever: There was a kind of typ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ut of this, in the ſlaying the firſt-born of <hi>Egypt:</hi> At that time, who muſt be preſerved? Why <hi>Iſrael:</hi> Now all <hi>Iſrael</hi> were Types of Gods own people, and in that God did Typically foretell what he would do in aftertime, eſpecially in the latter times, that his ſaved ones ſhould be his true <hi>Iſrael.</hi> There is a Scripture I will recommend to you, make what uſe of it the Lord ſhall help you, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4.3. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs, that he that is left in Zion, and he that remaineth in Jeruſalem ſhall be called holy, even every one that is written among
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:171179:38"/> the living in Jeruſalem:</hi> Now what time doth this relate unto? It was a time of great deſtruction, as you have it <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.26. <hi>Her gates ſhall lament and mourn, and ſhe being deſolate ſhall ſit upon the ground;</hi> and in <hi>verſ.</hi> 25. <hi>Thy men ſhall fall by the ſword, and thy mighty men in war:</hi> Now in this deſolation ſome ſhall eſcape, and who ſhall they be? What ſort of men ſhall they be? Mark what he ſays, and make of it as much as the Lord ſhall help you; they that eſcape of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they that are left in <hi>Sion,</hi> and they that remain in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhall be called holy; that is, ſhall be holy, for God calls things as they are, or he will make them to be what he calls them: And is that all? No, <hi>ſuch as are written among the living,</hi> or (as the word may be rendred) ſuch as are written to life in <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> written to life, is the ſame with being written in the Lambs book of life; ſuch as he will make holy, they ſhall be the eſcaped, they ſhall be preſerved. I will give you another text, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.22. It ſpeaks of the tribulations of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter times, moſt dreadful things; And what then? <hi>Except theſe days be ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, no fleſh ſhall be ſaved:</hi> They ſhould
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:171179:39"/> be ſuch as ſhould cut off every ſoul from the earth: but God hath an elect upon whom his heart is ſet, and for their ſakes it ſhall be ſhortned. The meaning of the text, I take to be this, there ſhall be dreadful tribulations in the latter days, ſuch as if they were let run on their courſe, would cut off eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſoul; but they ſhall be ſo cut ſhort, that a people written unto life ſhall out-live them. And if this be ſo, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is a great honor to out-live com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon calamities, eſpecially in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter days, into which we are come, or unto which we are drawing nigh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace.</p>
            <p>But one thing more, a third argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is this, it is an honorable thing to have preſervation in times of common calamity, if you conſider, That ſuch who are ſo preſerved, are preſerved to very honourable ends; God doth not preſerve them for nothing, but to very honorable ends; the Prophet <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66. tells us of dreadful providences, <hi>verſ.</hi> 15, 16. <hi>For behold, the Lord will come with fire,</hi> &amp;c. Well, ſhall any eſcape at that day? Yes, there ſhall, if you look to <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. <hi>And when ye ſee this, your
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:171179:39"/> heart ſhall rejoyce,</hi> &amp;c. The hand of the Lord that ſhall be known to his friends for their preſervation, to his enemies for their deſtruction; but to what end will he reſerve them that he doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve? That you have in <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. <hi>I will ſet a ſign among them, and I will ſend thoſe that eſcape of them to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi> the eſcaped people, what ſhall they be for? They ſhall be to make known, ſet up, and advance the glory of God, and to tell of his wondrous workings. I confeſs, that I conceive this text doth relate to the Jewiſh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but there ſhall be a remnant preſerved, and the reſerved are reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to honorable ends, to make known much of God, to reveal and ſpeak of his glory: To which add that <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. 28. you read of ſome that eſcaped the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e in that day of diſtreſs; and what do they eſcape for? It is <hi>to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare in Zion the vengeance of the Lord;</hi> they are a remnant reſerved to ſpeak the praiſe of God, to magnifie and admire him in the diſpenſations of his providence; and therefore being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to honorable ends, it is an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:171179:40"/> preſervation: That is the firſt thing in the Doctrine.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As it is an honor, ſo it is an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall mercy, to be preſerved in times of publike judgements; it is not like the honor of this world, which is but an empty blaſt of breath, but ſuch as is a mercy as well as an honor: and, Oh how great is the mercy of ſurviving, and out-living common calamities! I ſhall briefly ſhew you it is great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and it will be evidenced in the conſideration of ſix or ſeven particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It appears to be ſo, from the thankfulneſs of thoſe that have been preſerved: You ſhall find ſome ſouls have been much taken with the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, and have admired his kindneſs in the delivering a people from common calamity. <hi>David</hi> in his time under a common diſtreſs, how doth he admire the grace of God, that ſhined forth in his preſervation? What, ſaith <hi>David,</hi> they cut off, and I alive! What have I done? theſe ſheep what have they done? <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.7, 8. here was a reſerved people, a people b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ought back from Captivity, and what doth
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:171179:40"/> 
               <hi>Ezra</hi> ſay? Oh, ſaith he, it is great grace, there is abundance of mercy in it, that we ſhould be preſerved, that the Lord ſhould keep us alive, and hath not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered us to fall in our bondage, but hath given us a nail in his houſe. Now the thankfulneſs of a people delivered from ſuch calami<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y, is a great ground to think it a great mercy, <hi>Jer.</hi> 20.13. <hi>Sing unto the Lord, praiſe ye the Lord, for he hath delivered the ſoul of the poor from the hand of evil doers.</hi> Now that I ſay that the people of God are ſo thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for, and do praiſe God for, certainly it is a great mercy.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is a great mercy to be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in common calamities, if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this well, that though God may find ſome hono<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>able things upon his people, that he is pleaſed to honor with preſervation, yet (if he would look throughly) he might find ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in them that might provoke him to let them fall with others: It is true, God when he doth preſerve, doth find ſomething honorable upon thoſe that he doth preſerve, it is ſo for the moſt part; as he found faith in <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> a relying and recumbency upon him,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:171179:41"/> and therefore honored him with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91. the Lord found three things honorable upon a people, to which he annexeth a promiſe of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation; one you have <hi>verſ.</hi> 9, 10. He finds faith there, and that he honors with a promiſe of preſervation; and in the 11, 12. <hi>He ſhall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways:</hi> Here he finds a people walking wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h him, and therefore he promiſeth them preſervation. Now if God do find any thing of excellence upon a people, yet how often is it cold and dead, and at a very low ebb? if he finds faith, How much of unbelief is there in the ſoul? Alſo if he finds him walking with God, how much turning aſide? And is it not great mercy that God is yet pleaſed to crown them with preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, becauſe he finds but ſome ſmall matter of excellency upon them? You ſhall ſee how <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.3. <hi>If thou ſhouldeſt mark iniquities, Oh Lord, who ſhall ſtand?</hi> That is, if thou comeſt to ſearch us throughly, and reſolveſt to do according to all that thou ſeeſt in us, who then ſhall ſtand? But it is the kindneſs of God, that he
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:171179:41"/> doth not mark all iniquity, and doth not look upon every miſcarriage of his poor people, he covers m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ny of them; therefore in <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. how much are they there taken with Gods mercy? <hi>It is of the Lords mercies that we are not conſumed, becauſe his compaſſions fail not,</hi> verſ. 22.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is a great mercy, if you conſider Gods preſervations are ſpecial kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, a great deal of love goes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with: <hi>Hezakiah</hi> when he was ſick of the Plague, God carryeth him through it, he did not let him fall by it; and what ſaith he? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.17. Thou haſt not let me fall, but haſt kept me, and thou haſt done it in love to my ſoul: And to this add that 2 <hi>King.</hi> 19.30, 31. Mark it, the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> (I think it was) that did hardly beſtead poor <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who were greatly diſtreſſed by them; well, but ſaith God, <hi>Out of Sion ſhall go a remnant, and ſome ſhall eſcape;</hi> but how? Why, <hi>the zeal of the Lord of hoſts ſhall perform it.</hi> That is, his love and care ſhall be ingaged for a rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; ſo that it is great mercy to be preſerved, and that becauſe God doth preſerve in great kindneſs.</p>
            <pb n="74" facs="tcp:171179:42"/>
            <p n="4">4. It is a great mercy, if you conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that God oft ſhews a great deal of mercy to the ſouls of them that do eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape: in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4. you ſee what a mercy the Lord ſhews, and what good he doth upon the ſouls of thoſe that ſhould remain in <hi>Sion:</hi> in <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. The eſcaped remnant ſhall not carry their droſs along with them, but God will take away their droſs, and do away their filth: this ſhall be the mercy of this eſcaping remnant: and ſo <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.2, 3. <hi>Who may abide the day of his coming? and who ſhall ſtand when he appeareth?</hi> Why, what is it makes that day ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible? Oh this is it, <hi>He ſhall ſit as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finers fire, and as Fullers ſoap:</hi> In <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. Oh, ſaith he, when I come in my dreadful calamities and judgements, <hi>Jacob</hi> ſhall not be conſumned; Why not? what ſhall then be done upon him? He will take away their droſs, and their Tynn, and purifie them as Gold and Silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and truely this is more then to eſcape: to eſcape is not ſo much, as to eſcape it and your corruption too; to be out of trouble, and freed from
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:171179:42"/> ſin too, this is a mercy of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Great mercy to preſerved in and through a common calamity, in as much as it gives farther opportunity to get the ſoul into a better order, to mourn over paſt miſcarriages: for the ſoul of the beſt, and the frame of the beſt had need be better; and he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="6">6. It is a mercy, if you conſider the reſerved people are a reconciled peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; uſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So <hi>Jer.</hi> 50.20. <hi>I will pardon them whom I reſerve;</hi> I will not onely reſerve them, but I will pardon them: that is a mercy, and double mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to be a reſerved and a pardoned people.</p>
            <pb n="77" facs="tcp:171179:43"/>
            <p n="7">7. It is a great mercy to be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved through publike calamities, if you conſider God often makes the iſſue of it the inabling the ſoul to be more for God, and to walk more with him than ever at former times, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 37.31. <hi>And the remnant that is eſcaped of the houſe of Judah, ſhall again take root down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and bear fruit upward:</hi> It hath a ſpiritual as well as a litteral ſence, no doubt, They ſhall be a rooted people, and alſo a fruitful people: it is a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy when God makes the iſſue of theſe Diſpenſations, the purging of us, to make us bring forth more fruit; the fire of affliction, a means for their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, and conſequently of their bearing more fruit to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But 3. How do you walk with God? You muſt be in Gods way, if you will have his preſervation, <hi>He ſhall give his Angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways,</hi> that is, in all his ways, for we ſhould have no way, but Gods ways, all our ways ſhould be his ways.</p>
            <p>There are ſome things inconſiſtent with the walking with God, and it will be well if none of thoſe things be to be found upon our ſouls.</p>

            <p>There be three things that expoſe men to the ſtroke of the judgement of God, and cut them ſhort of mercy many times, <hi>viz.</hi> Unbelief, Preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Secu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ity; and any one of them doth it as well as the other.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Unbelief, I ſay that cuts ſhort of a great deal of mercy, particularly in ſuch a day as this: if you will be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed through the wilderneſs, watch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt unbelief.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Security: a people not being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the judgements of God, it lays them as much open to the weight of the judgement, as any thing elſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.11. <hi>And the harp, and the

            <p n="3">3. Preſumption alſo, which they call Faith, and that doth as certainly lay open the ſoul to miſery, as any other thing that hath been hinted.</p>
            <p>Now conſider a little how it is with you; is your Faith true Faith, or is it not Security? Is it not Preſumption? Are you ſure it is Faith? if not, it will do you no ſervice. You may think it is Faith, when it may prove ſomewhat elſe, it may prove ſecurity: you think you have faith, becauſe you have not fear: I tell you ſouls, there may and ſhould be an aw of God, and yet be faith, as I will tell you by and by. You may think it faith, becauſe you are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, and not much affected; but take heed leſt it ſhould diſappoint thee: if it be not faith, it may lay you open to the judgement of God, and cut you ſhort of being one of the eſcaping remnant, as well as any thing elſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
            <p>If you have true Faith, you will know it by one or two things.</p>
            <pb n="96" facs="tcp:171179:53"/>
            <p n="1">1. You will be ſenſible of your great unworthineſs to receive any thing at the hand of God, or to be preſerved by him; that is the property of faith, it is an humbling Grace, a ſelf-abaſing Grace, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.22. <hi>It is of the Lords mercy we are not conſumed:</hi> Here was faith at work, and what effect had it upon their ſouls? Oh it made them ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſenſible of their unworthineſs, to receive any mercy at the Lords hand, <hi>It is of the Lords mercy that we are not conſumed.</hi> Call thy confidence what thou wilt, if it have not ſome effect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee of this kind, it is not true faith.</p>
            <p n="2">2 If thou haſt faith, it hath an allay and mixrure of a holy aw of the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God; faith is not a thing that makes a man ſtupid, but ſenſible and tender; faith as it looks to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe for preſervation, ſo it ſeet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ible God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſoul that knows who he is, and what he is, cannot but have an awe of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:171179:53"/> his judgement reſting upon him. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> was no Infidel, yet a man of fear, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.120. <hi>My fleſh trembleth for fear of thee, and I am afraid of all thy judgements. David</hi> had this, and it was no unbecoming fear; he had a holy awe of God: a dread of the judgements of God upon the ſoul, is ſo far from being inconſiſtent with faith, that it is a neceſſary concomitant of it.</p>
            <p>Again 3. Faith cuts not the throat of the uſe of means, but whilſt thou believeſt for preſervation, thou art waiting on God in the uſe of that means that he directs thee to; faith it puts upon the uſe of means, but doth not call off from it: You believe God for ſalvation, What then? you wait upon God in the uſe of Ordinances: Now by theſe things ask your hearts whether you have faith or no. Two or three things more, and I have done. Is preſervation ſuch a mercy? I would firſt ſay to you, Labor then to be Saints in earneſt, for if you ſhould be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and not be Saints, you looſe the mercy of your preſervation, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 15.4. <hi>His life ſhall be grievous unto him,</hi> &amp;c. The caſe of evil men is ſuch ſometimes,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:171179:54"/> that the very living is a burthen to them: and ſuch may be the caſe of a ſinner, though he may not be cut off, their life may be worſe to them then cutting off, <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.3. <hi>And death ſhall be choſen rather then life,</hi> &amp;c. the life of a ſinner is not worth the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Above all things, have as little to do with ſin as you can, that is one of the beſt preſervatives, <hi>Job</hi> 11.14. <hi>If iniquity be in thy tabernacle, put it far away from thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. And laſtly, while you are in the world, and diſtreſs is in the world, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially remember and be ſollicitous for the <hi>Sion</hi> of God. Oh ſtand up and plead for the poor people of <hi>Sion, Jer.</hi> 51.50. <hi>Let Jeruſalem come into your minds.</hi> Oh my friends, while the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes of this day laſts, <hi>Let Jeruſalem come into your mind!</hi> If God preſerve you, I ſay, while he p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <pb n="99" facs="tcp:171179:54"/>
            <p>And thus I have diſpatched the third Doctrine, namely, that it is a great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and an eſpecial mercy, and that that Saints ſhould put out hard for, to be delivered in times of common cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now go on with the fourth Obſervation from the words, That watchfulneſs and prayer are rare pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervatives, and excellent means for ſafety in the time of common calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. I dare not ſay they are never-fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing means, but they are the beſt means, and that as ſeldom fail as any; they are the beſt preſervatives you can have, and will do you moſt ſervice of any thing; if there be any ſafety to be had, it is in the uſe of theſe means. That is the note I would ſpend a little time upon; the God of all our mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies knows how to make it of uſe to us.</p>
            <p>I would treat a little diſtinctly on each of them, and ſhew how far each of them ſerve to this deſign; what part prayer hath in it, and what part watchfulneſs: I ſhall begin with the firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> Prayer; and in what I have
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:171179:55"/> to ſay to that, I ſhall propound three things to be treated on.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Conſider a little what prayer is, becauſe if we miſtake the thing it ſelf, we are out in the whole, as if a skilful Phyſician preſcribe one potion, and it be miſtaken, and another taken for it, inſtead of doing good it may do much harm; therefore it is good to know what prayer is.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider, what prayer is wont to do: When Phyſicians preſcribe a remedy, they will tell you what great cures ſuch medicines have effected; and therefore I ſhall ſhew you what prayer hath done, and then how it comes to be particularly uſeful in this caſe of a common calamity.</p>
            <p>For the firſt then, what is Prayer: we oft ſpeak of going to prayer, but what is praying? Why prayer it may be thus deſcribed: It is the breathing of a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſoul, in the help of the Spirit of Grace, whereby it is inabled to go to God in a promiſe, in the Name of Chriſt, to begg ſuitable mercy as the caſe may require. I will take this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription in parts, and confirm each part unto you, that you may ſee it is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:171179:55"/> conſonant and agreeable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the word of truth.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all, I ſay, prayer is the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the ſoul; heartleſs prayer is no prayer, it is the work of the ſoul, the work of the heart; and that in which the heart is not, is not prayer at all: hence you have that expreſſion in <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.16. <hi>The effectual fervent prayer of the righteous availeth much;</hi> it may be better rendred, The Inwrought prayer of the righteous; prayer it is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrought thing, it is firſt wrought in the heart, before it is brought forth into petitions; and if it be not firſt wrought in the heart before it is brought forth into deſires and petitions, it is not prayer. The heart muſt go whatſoever is w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nting; whether you pray with the voice or not, you muſt pray with the heart; ſuch a thing you read of in the known caſe of <hi>Hannah,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Hannah ſhe ſpeaks in her heart onely, her lips moved, her voice was not heard,</hi> ſhe ſpake in her heart, her heart was in the prayer, and it was a ſign it was, by the good iſſue it had. <hi>David Pſal.</hi> 119. 145. hath an expreſſion that looks that way, <hi>I cryed with my whole heart, Oh
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:171179:56"/> Lord I will keep thy ſtatutes:</hi> If you cry, it muſt be with the heart, that muſt not be wanting; for if that be wanting, truely the beſt ingredient of prayer is wanting; hence you have that expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.1. <hi>I lift up my ſoul un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee:</hi> the meaning is, I pray unto thee, I call unto thee; but he doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it by lifting up the ſoul, becauſe the ſoul was ingaged in the work, <hi>I lift up my ſoul unto thee;</hi> the like expreſſion you have <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86.4.</p>
            <p>Now that is the firſt thing in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, it is the breathing of the ſoul.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is the breathing of a gracious ſoul: it is not every heart, but a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious heart that knoweth how to pray, the breathings of a gracious ſoul, and therefore whatever name the deſires of a wicked man may have, yet alas it doth not amount to prayer, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.8. <hi>The ſacrifice of the wicked it is an abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto the Lord, but the prayer of the upright is his delight:</hi> A wicked man may bring his ſacrifice, may think to put up his petition, but what is it? <hi>It is an abomination unto the Lord, but the prayer of the upright that is his delight.</hi>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:171179:56"/> When God comes to ſpeak of the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the wicked, ſee h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>w he is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to phraſe it, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7.14. Says he, <hi>They have not cryed u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>to me with their hearts, when they have houled upon their beds:</hi> The prayer they put up is no better then the howling of a dogg; if it be not the voice of a gracious heart, it is but the voice of a dog, and you know it is ſo called in the Scripture; and hence in <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10. it is ſaid, he will pour out upon the houſe of <hi>David</hi> the Spirit of Grace and of ſupplication; fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt the Spirit of Grace, and then the Spirit of Supplication; if there be not firſt a ſpirit of grace, truely there can be no ſpirit of ſupplication: and it was hence that <hi>Saul</hi> when he was effectually wrought upon and the work of grace was begun in his heart, the ſpirit of God takes notice of it, <hi>Behold he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:</hi> doubtleſs he had made many a long prayer, and done ſomething that he called prayer before that time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Phariſee, and one of the ſtricteſt Sect, but yet he never prayed untill now; now there is grace in his heart, and he prayeth to purpoſe: that is the ſecond thing, it is the breathing of a gracious ſoul.</p>
            <pb n="104" facs="tcp:171179:57"/>
            <p n="3">3. It is done in the help of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Grace: for if a gracious ſoul come and ſpeak his own words, that is not praying, it muſt be ſpeaking the words of the Spirit of God, the breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the petitions that are put into the heart by the Spirit of God. <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10. a place I quoted even now, you read that it is a Spirit of Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Gods good Spirit it helps and furthers, and forwards the ſoul in this great work, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. <hi>We know not what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit it ſelf helps our infirmities;</hi> and truely ſouls, this is very conſiderable, when praying is as it ſhould be, it is done in the help of the Spirit of grace.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In prayer the ſoul goeth to God, as the Father and fountain of mercy; he goes to him, directs a prayer unto him, therefore <hi>David</hi> ſays in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.1. <hi>To thee, O Lord, I lift up my ſoul;</hi> and we are taught when Chriſt teacheth us how to pray in <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.9. to go unto God, <hi>Say,</hi> ſaies Chriſt, <hi>Our Father;</hi> we are bid to go to him, and to go to him as to a Father.</p>
            <pb n="105" facs="tcp:171179:57"/>
            <p>And further, 5. Prayer is going to God, and a going to him in a promiſe; you muſt have a promiſe to incourage you to pray: mark this as a certain rule, you have no warrant to ask that of God of which you have not a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, or ſomething that is in the nature of a promiſe: and if you ask me what I mean by ſomething in the nature of a promiſe, why it is the experience of the Saints of God, what he hath done for them, and wrought for them; this is in the nature of a promiſe, and you may plead it with God, that what he hath wrought his ſervants of old, that he would do again: now by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe I mean the Word of God, to plead for ſomething that God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Why he had a promiſe, <hi>And thou ſaidſt, I will ſurely do thee good,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. He urgeth God with his promiſe, Lord thou haſt ſaid thou wilt do me good, and make my ſeed as the ſand of the Sea; If <hi>Eſau</hi> come and kill my children, How ſhall this promiſe be fulfilled? Therefore <hi>deliver me, I pray
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:171179:58"/> thee,</hi> &amp;c. And in <hi>Rev</hi> 22.20. <hi>He which teſtifieth theſe things, ſaith, Surely I come quickly: Even ſo, come Lord Jeſus.</hi> Mark, here is the promiſe, and the pleading of it alſo, both in this verſe; the promiſe, Chriſt ſaies, <hi>Surely I come;</hi> the pleading of the promiſe, <hi>Amen, even ſo come Lord Jeſus:</hi> ſo if we come to God in prayer, we muſt plead a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, or ſomething in the nature of a promiſe, or elſe it is not pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p n="6">6. We muſt go to God in the name of Chriſt: now that is not (you will eaſily grant) the bare ſaying we ask this in the name of Chriſt, and beg it for Chriſts ſake; but the putting forth an act of f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="7">7. They go for ſuitable mercy, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as their needs and neceſſities are: The neceſſities of the Saints are not always the ſame, ſometimes they are of one kind and ſometimes of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the ſpirit of grace helps the ſoul to begg mercies ſuitable to its wants; ſometimes not to be led into temptation, as Chriſt teacheth us to pray, and ſometimes to be delivered from trouble, as <hi>David Pſal.</hi> 59.1. <hi>Deliver me from mine enemies, O God, defend me from thoſe that riſe up againſt me.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>Again 2.

               </gap>eck and kiſſed him. Thus God ſometimes prevents the thing that we fear; and ſo in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. in the caſe of <hi>Jehoſaphat,</hi> when many Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons combine to fight againſt him, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. <hi>Jehoſaphat feared,</hi> and what then? <hi>He ſet himſelf to ſeek the Lord, and

I quote all this, to this end onely, to tell you what great work and mighty ſervice ſometimes prayer doth, it helps to keep off the things that we fear.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It helps to remove the evils we feel, as well as prevents what we fear: you know when <hi>Iſrael</hi> was in bondage, what was a means to help them out, <hi>Exod.</hi> 2.23. <hi>They cryed, and their cry came up;</hi> they cryed, and it was not in vain, for God heard them, their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſeeking his face it did not prove fruitleſs: in <hi>Judges</hi> 5. you have a notable expreſſion of <hi>Deborah, O my ſoul, thou haſt troden down ſtrength:</hi> the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were greatly oppreſſed and dealt hardly with, and there were ſome ſtirred up to go out and oppoſe; but what got the victory? Oh, ſaith ſhe, <hi>My ſoul, thou haſt trodden down ſtrength!</hi> It was her ſouls going to God in prayer, it was that did the work,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:171179:61"/> and it was inſtrumental for the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that great oppreſſion that was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; and therefore the Prophet in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10. When he foretells their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from the yoak of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> bondage, ſaith he, the yoak ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed becauſe of the anointing, <hi>verſ.</hi> 27. that evil ſhall be removed, How! by the anointing, one part of the ſenſe whereof is, that a part of the ſpirit of grace and ſupplication ſhould be pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red forth on the people, they ſhould plead with God, and becauſe of that anointing, they ſhould be delivered, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.1, 2. <hi>I waited patiently for the Lord and cryed unto him, and he incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto me, and heard my cry:</hi> he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and God heard him, and this was the iſſue, <hi>He brought me up alſo,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>verſ.</hi> 2, 3. that is a third thing, it delivers from many evils felt as well as feared.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It prevails for ſtrength to ſtand up under, and grapple with great difficulty: when God thinks not fit to remove dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, then the ſoul prays for ſtrength to ſtand up under thoſe difficulties, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.31. <hi>They that wait on the Lord, ſhall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

That <hi>ſome out of weakneſs were made ſtrong;</hi> that is the fourth thing that Prayer doth.</p>
            <p n="5">5.

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ſeful for our preſervation in common calamity? It comes to be uſeful in that, as in all other caſes, theſe four or five wayes:</p>
            <p n="1">1. From a great deal of efficacy that is in it; it is a thing that hath a great deal of efficacy and power going along with it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.7. <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.22. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.16.</p>
            <p>But, 2. It comes to be effectual, in that it ſues out and pleads the Promiſe: the prayer of Faith it challengeth God with his word, it pleads out the Promiſe in the preſence of God; it goes to that, and takes hold of it; and many p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>omiſes I have heretofore quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted you, that God hath given for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation in common calamity. Now it is the work of the people of God, to go to God and ſue them out, to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber him of his promiſe, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. <hi>Jehoſaphat,</hi> when he is at prayer there, he remembers God of his promiſe, <hi>verſ.</hi> 8, 9, 10. he goeth to prayer, and there he pleads the promiſe; <hi>Lord,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>at the dedication of this Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, didſt thou not engage, that if we ſtood by this houſe, called by thy Name, in a time of calamity, didſt thou not promiſe that thou wouldſt be with us?</hi> This is that
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:171179:63"/> that he remembers God of; and the people of God they are called Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrancers, in the Propheſie of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> Chap. 62. <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>You that make mention of the Lord;</hi> it is in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, <hi>You that are the Lords remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancers: Prov.</hi> 18.10. it is ſaid, <hi>The Name of the Lord is a ſtrong Tower, the righteous run thither and are ſaved:</hi> this running is a running in prayer, in a prayer of faith, when the ſoul in prayer doth put the Lord in mind, that he hath ſaid, he is a <hi>ſtrong Tower,</hi> and will be a <hi>Refuge,</hi> and therefore beg of him to be according to his word; that is a ſecond thing, it prevails for preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, in that it pleadeth the promiſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It prevails, in that it is Gods own Ordinance and appointment, the means that he hath given us to prevail in any caſe; and he is pleaſed to put that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour upon the head of prayer, that it ſhall be a door to let in mercy to us. When he had promiſed to do a great deal for <hi>Iſrael, yet,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>for all this I will be ſought of them;</hi> it is prayer fetcheth in the mercy, <hi>Job</hi> 11.13. <hi>If thou prepare thine heart, and ſtretch out thine hand towards him,</hi> &amp;c. And in
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:171179:63"/> 
               <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. <hi>Thou ſhalt be ſtedfaſt, and ſhalt not fear.</hi> Mark, particular preſervation is promiſed to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e given forth in a way of prayer.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As it is uſeful to remove that that may pull on a calamity, and may make the Lord ſtrike us with ſuch a ſtroke: you know ſin is that that brings all judgment; now the prayer of Faith is very inſtrumental and ſerviceable in order to the taking away of guilt, and removing of ſin; and by faith in prayer we go to Chriſt, and take hold of him, and leave our guilt upon him, leave him to grapple with the Fathers diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure: This we do by Prayer. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> you know, when he would be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved himſelf from the Plague, he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and offereth a Sacrifice; I think I have hinted to you what that was</p>
            <p n="5">5. Thus it comes to do us ſervice: if it be right, and as it ſhould be, we put up no petition but what God firſt puts into our hearts. Now, if prayer be right, it is God's work, and he is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to ſtand to his own act; if God put me upon pleading for preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is a tye upon God to anſwer it, for it is his own work, and therefore he
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:171179:64"/> muſt not diſown his own work. Upon this account it is that prayer comes to be uſeful to our preſervation; I ſhal now proceed to ſhew you a litle the great uſe of watchfulnes, in order to preſervation. 1. In that it helps to prayer; prayer is a great means to our preſervation, and watchfulneſs is a hand-maid to prayer; there is no praying well without it: It is a furtherance and help to us, 1. In that it finds out the moſt apt and fit ſeaſon for pray<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r: there are certainly fit, and apt, and proper ſeaſons in which the ſoul may do much more in prayer then it can do at other times; and it is the part of watchfulneſs to ſpie and finde out thoſe opportunities; and therefore you have a notable expreſſion in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.7. <hi>The end of all things is at hand, be ye ſober therefore, and watch unto prayer;</hi> that is, let your watch ſerve you to find out the beſt, fitteſt and apteſt ſeaſons, and the greateſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages to further you in prayer: doubtleſs there are ſeaſons in which the heart is beſt framed for the duty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſeaſons in which God ſeems to give ſome ſecret inclinations to the ſoul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he will pleaſe to be beſought<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:171179:64"/> Now when the ſoul hath any great ſuit to go forward with, and any great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt to preſent at the Throne of grace, the ſoul then watches to find out ſuch a ſeaſon; and this doth further the duty of prayer exceedingly.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It furthers prayer, in that it keeps up the heart when it is engaged in that work; and therefore you find them coupled together, in <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.41. <hi>Watch and pray,</hi> ſaith he. Souls, let me tell you, if you pray, and do not watch, you will hardly get the heart to pray; but if you do get the heart there, you will hardly keep it there, unleſs you ſtand upon your watch. It is a truth much experienced, that a ſoul is no longer kept to duty, then a watchful eye is born over it: conſider it, it may help you many times, if it be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, that watchfulneſs conſiders how the heart is, how the Tempter deals with the ſoul, what pains he takes to diſtract, and get the ſoul out of a duty in which it is engaged; ſometimes you are dead, it is watchfulneſs findes it out; and therefore <hi>David</hi> being upon his watch, as well as in the way of his duty, he prays often in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:171179:65"/> 
               <hi>Quicken thou me;</hi> ſometimes the heart is diſtracted, wandring and getting aſide from the work that is before it, it is watchfulneſs that makes this diſcovery; it obſerves how Satan moves, &amp; how the ſoul moves in a duty, whether to God or no; I may allude to that you have, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.9. when God comes to confirm the Covenant unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> and bid him ſacrifice and divide the H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ifer, and the Turtle-doves, and young Pigeons, in <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. <hi>When the fowls came down upon the carcaſes,</hi> Abraham <hi>drove them away.</hi> I may allude to it thus: When you come to ſacrifice, fowls come down upon the ſacrifice, oft-times temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, diviſions, diſtractions, attend you; they are fowls upon the ſacrifice that do ſpoyl it, and it is watchfulneſs that muſt help you to keep off the fowls from the ſacrifice, and it is that that muſt obſerve how the caſe ſtands with you. Now this is that which watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs doth in prayer; it keeps the heart unto God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It helps to take in, and improve anſwers of prayer; the ſoul when it hath prayed, hath not done all its work, but it is to look after anſwers of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:171179:65"/> and that is the part of watchfulneſs; watchfulneſs looks after the petitions put up, and obſerves how they ſpeed, and what comes of them: ſayes <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bakkuk, I will ſtand upon my watch-tower, and will watch to ſee what he will ſay unto me:</hi> you muſt watch unto prayer, watch in prayer, and watch when you have prayed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> watch to ſee what comes of the petitions you have put up, and what anſwer you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and how God comes into your ſouls in a way of return to the requeſts you have lodged with him, <hi>Mich.</hi> 7.7. <hi>Therefore I will look,</hi> &amp;c. I will look unto God by Faith and Prayer; and when I have done, I will watch to ſee what the God of my ſalvation ſaith to me. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.1. <hi>I waited patiently for the Lord, and he heard me.</hi> I cryed, and when I had done, I waited to ſee what would come of it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.3. <hi>I will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect my prayer unto thee, and I will look after it;</hi> I will ſee how it will ſucceed. Well, you will ſay, what if watchfulneſs do help to look after anſwers of prayer, how doth this farther preſervation? Why, theſe two wayes it's helping you to ſee what anſwer God makes to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:171179:66"/> prayer, furthers your preſervation two ways.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If you have no anſwer, it puts you upon praying again, untill God doth give you a word to hope in for you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſafety in days of evil.</p>
            <p>Or ſecondly, If when you have prayed, and are upon your watch, ſo that you have found an anſwer, it helpes you to improve it for your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation; it helpes you to plead the anſwer that God hath given you: if you find he h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th anſwered you in the deſire of your hearts, it helps you to hang upon God, and plead it with God as did <hi>David, Pſalm.</hi> 119.49. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thy word unto thy ſerva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e anſwer; and if thou art not upon thy watch, thou mayeſt not ſee it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is ſerviceable to preſervation as it helps to keep you from the ſin and provocations, that might, if lived in, provoke God to cut you off among the number that fall. I tell you ſouls, there are many provocations; when a ſoul is found under them, they do won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully ſtir up the Spirit of God againſt
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:171179:66"/> him, and provoke God to cut them off in the time of his anger; and it is the part of watchfulneſs to keep you from them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. <hi>Bleſſed is he that watches and keepeth his garments;</hi> you cannot keep your garments if you do not watch; ſuch are the corruptions of your hearts, and the ſubtilty of the tempter, that he will quickly make you defile your garments, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Let not us ſleep as do others, but let us watch and be ſober.</hi> All kind of ſin it is an intemperance, if you are not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your watch you will be wanting in your ſob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>iety, you will quickly run in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ways of ſin, if you are not found upon the duty of Watchfulneſs. Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs doth eſpeci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>There are four or five ſins that it is very bad to be found under, againſt all which watchfulneſs is an excellent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative.</p>
            <p n="1">1.

Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſin it is that God eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends for in any day of common cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, Oh ſouls as you love tender and regard your own preſervation,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:171179:67"/> come not nigh it: But of this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Leaning unto your own wiſdom, that is a very bad thing; we are to truſt the wiſdom of God, and lean upon him for all our preſervation. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſome of them when there was a great part carryed captive by the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> in <hi>Jer.</hi> 42.15, 16. <hi>Hear the word of the Lord, ye remnant of Judah,</hi> &amp;c. I quote it to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to ſhew you that when a man ſets up his wiſdom in direct oppoſition to Gods wiſdom, he thereby forfeits his preſervation; but w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>en a ſoul comes and ſays, Lord I will be what thou wouldeſt have me, and do what thou requireſt of me; this is a good frame: but I ſay to lean unto our own under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and not to ask counſel of God, not to walk as he directs, it is the direct way to forfeit our preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Not conſidering the judgements of God, is another ſin that watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will keep the heart from; you know how ill God takes it at the hand of a people to be inſenſible under his judgements, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.11, 12. <hi>Wo unto
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:171179:68"/> them,</hi> &amp;c. they are a ſottiſh people, a people that are not affected with Gods judgements, and therefore what then? at <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. The Lord will deſtroy them, <hi>Therefore,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>hell hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged her borders,</hi> &amp;c. Now I tell you ſouls, a watchful ſpirit will not eaſily run into this evil; no, no, it looks out, it ſpies the hand of God; watchfulneſs keeps the eye of faith open, it keeps the ſoul from ſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mbering and keeping, and inables the ſoul to ſee that mercy that ſhines forth in the diſpenſations of God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Unthankfulneſs for daily preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, this is a great evil, and that that watchfulneſs will excellently pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve you from; God uſually walks by this rule, he that prizeth and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth a little, to him he gives more; ſo he that prizes and improves, and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully owns, the daily preſervation and protection of God, ſuch a one is in the way to receive more at the hand of God; but when the daily goodneſs of God is ſlighted and paſt over, without conſideration, and being carefully heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and regarded by any ſoul; ſuch a ſoul is like to be left to fall under the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:171179:68"/> ſtroke of Gods indignation; it was the care of the Church in the <hi>Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations</hi> to give God his glory, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.22, 23. <hi>It is of the Lords mercies that we are not conſumed,</hi> &amp;c. his mercy eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry morning ſhould be prized and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by us.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, A proud unhumbled frame of ſoul, is that that watchfulneſs will help us againſt: ſouls, wherever that is found, it is a grievous provocation; God he delights to do good unto his poor broken humble ſouls, <hi>He reſiſts the proud, but he gives grace unto the humble;</hi> and therefore watchf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lneſs being an excellent means to keep us from theſe and other ſuch like ſins, which lay a people exceedingly open to the ſtroke of Gods indignation; it ſo becomes very uſeful and ſerviceable to our preſervation.</p>
            <p>And thus I have diſpatched the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinal part. Give me leave to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this Doctrine in a little Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to inforce theſe duties of watchfulneſs and prayer. Let me hence, firſt, take up a few things for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</p>
            <pb n="128" facs="tcp:171179:69"/>
            <p>And if ſo be that watchfulneſs and prayer are means that have ſo great a tendency to preſervation, it may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us of two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. How ill it is like to fare with poor ſinners, that can neither watch nor pray: if the infinite over-flowing goodneſs of God prevent not, they muſt periſh, they cannot make uſe of the means of preſervation: What can we expect but that they ſhould periſh? Oh that we could put on bowels of pitty for ſuch ſouls! the ſacrifice of the wicked, what is it, but an abomination unto the Lord: ſinners in the day of their proſperity they will not look af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God, nor his counſel, neither will they mind his dealings; if they do come in a day of diſtreſs, and cry and howl, and make much ado, they may do ſo, but yet God hath told them it ſhall be little to their comfort, for <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.26. he hath told them, that he <hi>w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>l laugh at their calamities, and mock <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hen their fear cometh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. We may infer alſo that here is room for the fall of Saints: whatever promiſe of preſervation is made, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right ſouls may fall; and why ſo? Why
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:171179:69"/> we m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y neglect the being found in our duty; we may not watch, and pray, as we ſhould and ought; we may pray, but it may be coldly, and without any fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of ſpirit; we may not follow cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our duty with God; and therefore miſſing in the means, we may miſs in the end alſo: and that is my firſt Uſe, a Uſe of <hi>Inference.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It ſhould ſtir us up to commune with our hearts a little: what do we? do we watch and pray? are we in the Uſe of the Means? whatever other means we uſe, we ſhould not let this be neglected; it is not preſervatives and removing from place to place, that can do you that ſervice, that watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and prayer can. You will ſay, you do pray; let me ask you again, do you watch unto prayer? I hope you can ſay you do.</p>
            <p>And if you ſhould ask me how you may know watchful prayer, I ſhall give you a few Characters of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If it be watchful prayer, there is an exciting, ſtirring and calling up the heart unto the Duty, <hi>Judges</hi> 5.12. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake</hi> Deborah <hi>awake;</hi> ſhe calls up her ſelf, and ſtirs up her ſelf to this
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:171179:70"/> Duty, as you finde the Servants of God have done, they ſtirred up all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of their ſouls, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 57.8. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake up my glory,</hi> ſaith <hi>David;</hi> It is the Soul he calls his glory: And <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> in the ninth chapter, he ſaith, <hi>I ſet my face to the Lord God,</hi> at the third verſe; the ſetting a mans ſelf, is the provoking and calling a mans ſelf unto the Duty. Now do you ſtir up and call up your hearts to the work of God? If you be in a watchful frame you will do ſo.</p>
            <p>Again, if it be watchful prayer, it is accompanied with much fervency; if you watch at prayer, it is not a cold lifeleſs Duty; it is a Duty hath heat, and vigor, and life in it, if you watch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it: the Rule is, <hi>Not ſlothful in bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs: but fervent in ſpirit, ſerving the Lord,</hi> as it is in the <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.11. And if there be a watchfulneſs in the Duty, there will be fervency going along with it. It is ſaid of <hi>Elias, James</hi> 5.17. that <hi>He prayed earneſtly;</hi> you read al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of an effectual prayer, and if it be watchful, it muſt be a fervent prayer.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If it be a watchful prayer, it is attended with much importunity, you
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:171179:70"/> preſs God and wreſtle with him: <hi>Jacob</hi> watched all night at it, and it was an importunate prayer; <hi>I will not let thee go unleſs thou bleſs me:</hi> The poor wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Canaan,</hi> hers was an impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate prayer, ſhe followed and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued her requeſt although ſhe had ſome repulſes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.22, 23, 26, 27.</p>
            <p>Now conſider how it is with you, for hereupon much of your ſafety may depend for ought I know; If you would be preſerved in this day of cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, as you pray for it, ſo you muſt watch in prayer, and ſee that there be that watchful frame of ſoul that is ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table unto this Rule and Counſel of Jeſus: that is the ſecond Uſe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly and laſtly, ſhould we watch and pray always in every ſeaſon?</p>
            <p>I would then firſt ſay, Make ſeaſons for prayer; ſpare them out of ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, rather then want them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I would ſay, Take ſeaſons for prayer when you may beſt attend the Work, and hope moſt to prevail with God. If you ask me what are the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons? a word or two of that, and I ſhall come to the fifth Propoſition from the words.</p>
            <pb n="132" facs="tcp:171179:71"/>
            <p n="1">1. I ſay your leiſure-ſeaſons, when you are not engaged in buſineſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſeaſons when your ſpirits are moſt ſerious, and leaſt diſtracted; it is not good to ſet to duty in a croud, if you can help it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When the Spirit of God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes you to come into the preſence of God; you that are experienced Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, can ſay, that you have found ſometimes your ſouls longing to be in his Preſence; You have hungred after Communion with God in Duty; Oh, take that time! that is a fit ſeaſon.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When God hath warmed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed thy heart in a Duty, under any Ordinance with any tokens of love, it is I ſay a fit ſeaſon for thee to improve with the Lord: God doth ſometimes give the ſoul a look of love to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage it to wait upon him; Now take that ſeaſon: it is a great part of Wiſdom to know a ſeaſon; and if you ſhall finde a ſeaſon offering it ſelf to you apt, and fit, and proper for your go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God, take it and bleſs God for it, and improve it with all your ſoul and might; it is much Mercy, and a great deal of goodneſs may come in to you at that door.</p>
            <pb n="133" facs="tcp:171179:71"/>
            <p>And thus now I have diſpatced the fourth Obſervation, namely, that watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and prayer are the beſt means and have the greateſt tendency to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation in times of common cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>
            <p>I come now to the fifth and laſt Note from the words, namely this, That the eſcaping common calamities, is not the only thing, nor the chief thing that we are to be careful about, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially, and above other things, how we ſhall ſtand before the Son of man.</p>
            <p>Alas! to ſtand in a day of calamity is one thing, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut to ſtand before the Son of man is another, and a far more weighty thing, as I purpoſe to ſhew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.</p>
            <p>This is that the Lord ſaies in this Scripture, Do what you may, watch and pray, and uſe the beſt means you can, to eſcape in a day of calamity; but remember, when that is done, all is not done, nor is the great thing done; remember after all, whether you ſtand or fall in a calamity, you muſt ſtand before the Son of man: If you fall in a calamity, that will not end all. It is appointed to all men once to dye, and
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:171179:72"/> after that the judgement: if you do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape a calamity, there will be a time when you muſt ſtand before the Son of man; ſo that whether you ſtand or fall, that is not the main thing, nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially conſiderable buſineſs, but the great and main thing about which you are to be eſpecially careful, is how you may do to look Chriſt in the face at laſt, how you may do to hold up your head before the Son of man. Standing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Son of man is taken three ways in Scripture.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Meerly for appearing before him, for appearing at his Tribunal; ſo it is taken ſometimes in the Scriptures, for inſtance, that in the <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.10. <hi>We ſhall all appear before his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>udgement-ſeat.</hi> So, 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 5.10. <hi>For we muſt all appear before the Judgement-ſeat of Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Revel.</hi> 20.12. verſ. <hi>And I ſaw the dead, both ſmall and great, ſtand before God,</hi> &amp;c. That is the firſt ſence it is taken in in Scripture, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for appearing before the Son of man.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To ſtand before him, it is taken for an eſtate of honour and promotion, as to ſtand before a P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ince, we reckon
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:171179:72"/> ſuch a perſon is preferred and highly honoured, as it was ſaid of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s ſervants, <hi>Happy are thy ſervants, which ſtand continually before thee, and hear thy Wiſdom,</hi> as you have it, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 9.7.</p>
            <p>And thirdly, it is taken for ſtanding with joy, and comfort, and boldneſs; and it is upon that accompt, that you have that expreſſion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.5. <hi>The ungodly ſhall not ſtand in the judgement, nor ſinners in the Congregation of the Righteous;</hi> They ſhall ſtand in one ſence, though not in another; they ſhall all ſtand in it, ſo as to come to it; but they ſhall not ſtand with comfort, ſo as to hold up their heads: ſtanding here is oppoſed to adjection of ſpirit, of falling before the dreadful Majeſty of God, and our Saviour: They ſhall not ſtand; that is, ſuch dread ſhall ſeize upon their ſouls, that they ſhall not be able to lift up their heads, they ſhall be ſo filled with confuſion and ſhame, that they ſhall not be able to hold up their heads in that day. So ſtanding before the Son of man is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in this ſence in my Text, eſpecially; that you may be able to ſtand before the Son of man, is, that you may be
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:171179:73"/> able to ſtand before him with comfort, that you may lift up your head with joy, when the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
            <p>In the proſecution of this great truth, I ſhall propound the conſideration of ſeveral things to you; and I would do it ſo, as I may beſt keep to the deſign of the text, as the Lord ſhall inable me.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I would indeavor to ſhew you that the ſtanding before Chriſt is a much more ſerious and weighty thing, then any calamity in this world can be; whatever dread there is upon the heart at the thoughts of a calamity, we may have much more fear, and many more thoughts of heart upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ſtanding before the Son of man at his appearance and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I ſhall indeavour to ſhew you that they that will not tremble at a judgement, that they that are like to laugh a calamity in the face, will yet tremble when the Son of man ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that will put ſuch out of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance as are not abaſhed by any ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity they meet with in the world.</p>
            <pb n="137" facs="tcp:171179:73"/>
            <p n="3">3. I ſhall ſhew you who they are that ſhall never be able to ſtand before the S n of man.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Who they are, and what they muſt be that ſhall ſtand before him.</p>
            <p>And fifthly, What is the beſt frame a ſoul can be in, in o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>der to a meeting with Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>iſt, with the greateſt confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and boldneſs.</p>
            <p>And ſixthly and laſtly, conclude all in a little Application.</p>
            <p>But firſt of the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt, namely to ſhew you that the ſtanding before Chriſt is a much more ſerious and weighty thing, and ought to be more ſeriouſly thought of, and more ſolemnly provided for, then any common calamity whatſoever: Many gracious hearts do tremble at the thoughts of a common calamity; and truely there is reaſon why they ſhould do ſo; <hi>David</hi> himſelf did thus, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.120. <hi>My fleſh trembleth for fear of thee, and I am afraid of thy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:</hi> but you ſhall find that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſinners themſelves do tremble more, and are much more affected with the thoughts of induring the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſt, then the bearing up under any common calamity that can
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:171179:74"/> befall them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.13. ſaies the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God there, <hi>Hear ye that are afar off what I have done, and ye that are neer acknowledge my might,</hi> that is in my judgements which I execute; ſaies he, conſider them, ſee what weight and force there is in them: But mark, how is it with ſinners? in <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. <hi>The ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in Sion are afraid.</hi> Afraid of what? <hi>Fearfulneſs hath ſurpriſed the hypocrite,</hi> What is he afraid of? <hi>Who ſhall ſtand before the devouring fire? who ſhall dwell with everlaſting burnings?</hi> as if they ſhould have ſaid, There is a might, and there is a power and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of God appearing, and ſhining forth in all his judgements; but if you would have us ſpeak our hearts, and tell what we dread moſt, it is ſtanding before him in that great day, when he ſhall appear as a devouring fire; it is the being able to hold up the head at that ſeaſon, that doth diſtreſs us moſt, and fill us with dread and fear: I ſay, the ſtanding in the day of Chriſt is a much more difficult thing, then the ſtanding in a common calamity; and I ſhall ſhew you in ſeveral particulars how that day will out-do every thing
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:171179:74"/> that can be in a common calamity: I ſhall ſhew it you in eleven or twelve particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The day of Chriſt is more dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful then a calamity in this reſpect, that every calamity in this world is a call to repentance, but the day of Chriſts ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance is onely a call unto judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: I ſay calamities in this world, they are calls to repentance, to a ſinful people to return; the voice of the word is the firſt call, and ſinners are deaf and will not hear that call, and therefore God ſounds an alarm by his judgements, and by them he calls unto poor ſinners to repent and turn unto him; but now I ſay in the day of Chriſt there is no call unto repentance, nor place for repent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nce, he onely then calls to judgement: you ſhall find ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities are calls to repentance, and that is the fruit that God expects from them, that they ſhould work upon a rebellious people, and turn them to himſelf: look <hi>Amos</hi> 4. in divers verſes of that Chap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>er, you have God ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down the calamities he exerciſed the people with, and what he expected from them, <hi>Amos</hi> 4.6. Here was a

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:171179:76"/> and now what it is God expects, you may judge by the complaint is made, <hi>They repented not of the works of their hands,</hi> verſ. 20, 21. God expects that his people ſhould be a repenting, relenting people: to which add that <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.9, 10, 11. <hi>Men were ſcorched with great heat,</hi> &amp;c. in the pouring out of the vials, that are the laſt judgements that God will execute; they are the gteateſt: and mark now, even from the greateſt and laſt calamities that ſhall come upon the world, what is it God expects? it is a relenting, repenting, reforming, he ſtill calls to it; the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt calamities that he brings upon the world, that is the effect that he looks they ſhould have. But the coming of Chriſt will be another thing, when he comes it will not be a call to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, but a call to judgement; not a call to reform what thou haſt done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs, but to receive a doom for thy miſs-doing.

That is the firſt thing, the day of Chriſt will be a much more ſerious thing then any judgement in the world, becauſe judgements are calls unto repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, but when we come to ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt, it is a call unto judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

            <p>In outward calamities we deal with God remotely, and at a diſtance; but in the day of Chriſt, we muſt deal with Chriſt immediately. Oh that we could conſider this thing ſeriouſly! it is a weighty thing indeed to have to do with God immediately.</p>
            <p>Beloved, let me tell you, you would not be able to bear the preſence of Chriſt, if he ſhould but ſpeak to you immediately, you would not be able to bear his preſence; it would be ſo full of Glory and Majeſty, that you would not poſſibly ſtand up under it; much leſs ſhall we be able to bear the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate preſence of Chriſt, when he comes to judgement.

               </gap>h graciouſly ſo ordered it, that we ſhould have the Goſpel delivered to us by Creatures like our ſelves, becauſe we are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to bear the immediate preſence of God: And therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>We have this treaſure in earthen veſſels,</hi> 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 4.7.

            <pb n="145" facs="tcp:171179:77"/>
            <p>But my Brethren, in the day of Chriſt you muſt have to do immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with Chriſt himſelf; you muſt have to do with him immdiately, nothing ſtanding between Chriſt and you. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las! in a common calamity it is not ſo; God deals with you remotely, and at a diſtance: you do not ſee him in his Glory and Majeſty; but in that day you muſt have to do with him immediately: and therefore it is ſaid, <hi>We muſt ſtand before His Judgement-ſeat.</hi> God exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutes his judgements now in ſecret and hidden ways, but then he will him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf execute it immediately.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The day of Chriſt will be much more dreadful then any calamity, upon this account, becauſe in any calamity the Majeſty of God is veiled and hid; but in the day of Chriſt, God and Chriſt will appear in all their Majeſty, Beauty and Glory, in all their Excellence: I ſay, in a day of calamity the Majeſty and Glory of Chriſt is veiled and hid; it cannot be ſeen, they that ſee moſt of it, ſee but little: but in the day of Chriſt he will appear in all his Royalty and Glory.

It is true, we are ſaid to appear before the Son of man; He ſhall ſit as the Son of man, but yet he ſhall alſo ſit as God; which how ſhall it ſtartle every Chriſtleſs ſoul, that ſhall ſtand before the glory of that day! <hi>Matt.</hi> 25.31, 32. <hi>When the Son of man ſhall come <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="4">4. In the foreſt calamity that ever was, or ſhall be in the world, the Lord doth not deal in ſtrictneſs of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, not doth he come forth with all his wrath; but in the day of Chriſt he will then ſit upon the Throne, judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with exactneſs of Juſtice, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring to every one according to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt extent of all that they have done: There is much of the wrath of God is kept in, in the moſt wrathful providenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:171179:79"/> Lord puniſheth leſs then iniquity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerves; the moſt dreadful calamity hath not that terrour in it, that inquity calls for, and deſerves at the hand of God: And therefore the people of God in the <hi>Lament.</hi> 3.22. do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, <hi>It is the Lords mercies they are not conſumed.</hi> Any thing on this ſide being conſumed, and cut off from the preſence of God, is Mercy.</p>
            <p>Ah my Friends! however ſevere the Lord may ſeem in any of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences, he is not ſo ſevere as he might be, if he did ſtir up all his wrath, and deal in ſtrictneſs and exactneſs of ſeverity; but when Chriſt comes to judgement, every man ſhall have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his work: Poor ſinners ſhall then receive the utmoſt peny, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. <hi>We muſt all appear before the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-ſeat of Chriſt, that every one may receive the things done in his body, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what he hath done, whether good or bad.</hi> Upon earth men do not receive according to what is done, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſinfulneſs of ſin, but God in wrath remembers mercy; but at that day all men ſhall receive accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what they have done; there ſhall
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:171179:80"/> be a retribution according to the ſtrictneſs of Juſtice, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.5, 6. <hi>But after thy hardneſs, treaſureſt up wrath againſt the day of wrath,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo, <hi>Matt.</hi> 16.27. <hi>For the Son of man ſhall come in the Glory of his Father with his Angels: and then he ſhall reward every man according to his works:</hi> That is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother thing in which the greateſt day of common calamity, and the day of Chriſt differ exceedingly.</p>
            <p n="5">5. There is this Difference: Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities in this world they mainly light upon the outward man; but when Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt ſhall ſit in judgement, he will judge both inward and outward man together; he will reach the ſoul as well as the body, and have to do with that. Preſent calamity lights upon the outward man, it is the body at the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, is the ſeat of that. There be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſore calamities that do not reach the body, as the firſt diſtreſſes that fell on <hi>Job,</hi> which were ſore diſtreſſes, yet at firſt they did not ſo much as reach his body, <hi>Job</hi> 1.14, 16. <hi>There came a meſſenger that told him his Cattle were taken,</hi> &amp;c. theſe were ſore diſtreſſes, ſharp calamities; but yet all this while
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:171179:80"/> the body of <hi>Job</hi> was not ſo much as touched. And alſo ſometimes cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities do reach the body; the hand of God was upon <hi>Job</hi> himſelf in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion: and ſometimes it reaches the life; the poor carcaſe is carryed to earth. Thus it was with the firſt-born of <hi>Egypt;</hi> in the days of <hi>David,</hi> when many ſouls fell by that judgement, by the Plague; and if it do ſo, yet the dread of this is not like that that ſhall attend the coming of Chriſt: He ſhall ſit in judgement upon inward and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man at once: He ſhall reach the body as well as the ſoul at once. And therefore is that prayer of <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.23. And I pray God ſanctifie you wholly, and the Lord keep you in ſoul, body and ſpirit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as if he would have ſaid, The Lord look after the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and outward man, and keep them to the day of Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iſt, for Chriſt in his day will have to do with both: It will not be as it is in outward calamity, in which the body falls onely, but Chriſt will ſit in judgement upon the inward man alſo: And therefore it is ſaid in <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. <hi>Fear not him that can kill the body onely, but him that can caſt both
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:171179:81"/> body and ſoul into hell:</hi> Chriſt is able to reach ſouls as well as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>odies, and he will make it known that he is able to do it in the day of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Common calamity and the day of Chriſt differ upon this account: if in outward calamities upon the body, any ſin be brought to remembrance, it is not ſuch a bringing ſin to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance as ſhall be in the day of Chriſt; I confeſs in days of outward calamity, there is a bringing of ſin to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, but not ſuch as ſhall be in the day of Chriſt: God did bring ſin to <hi>Jobs</hi> remembrance in the time of his calamity, <hi>Job</hi> 13.26. <hi>Thou writest bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things againſt me, and makeſt me to poſſeſs the iniquities of my youth:</hi> This was the caſe of poor <hi>Job,</hi> he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der outward afflictions, and God alſo did ſet home ſome ſin upon his ſoul, and brought that to remembrance. And this was alſo the caſe of <hi>David,</hi> Look upon my pain, ſaies he, and forgive me my ſin; and therefore he prays in another verſe, <hi>Forgive me the ſins of my youth:</hi> In his affliction God made him remember the ſins of his youth: but in the day of Chriſt there will be another
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:171179:81"/> kind of bringing ſin to our remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, then there is in any calamity whatſoever: All the ſinners ſins ſhall then be preſented to him at once, with all their aggravations, with every cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance attending it; and what dread, what confuſion will it bring upon the heart, when it ſhall be at this paſs? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.21. <hi>Theſe things thou haſt done, and I kept ſilence, and thou thoughteſt I was altogether ſuch a one as thy ſelf: but I will ſet them in order before thee.</hi> Now the great day of ſetting them in order, it will be the day of Chriſt, that will be the ſpecial ſeaſon when the Lord will ſet them in order before the ſoul.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Farther, there is this difference: In outward calamities, God deals ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly with men, but in the day of Chriſt he will deal with them in the ſight of the whole world: In a cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity God deals ſecretly, and cuts off a ſinner now and then, and there is no great noiſe about it; but in the day of Chriſt he will deal with them in the ſight of all: now the publikeneſs or ſolemnity of an action makes it the more eminent and terrible: It puts a great deal more of dread and terror in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:171179:82"/> the malefactor, to be tryed and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted in the face of the Country; the ſolemnity increaſeth the terror. Oh my friends, when you come to ſtand before the Son of man, you ſhall ſtand alſo before men and Angels; the work of that day ſhall not be done in a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but whole heaven and earth ſhall be ſpectators, and witneſſes of what is done, and what paſſes in that day; and therefore it is ſaid in that foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned place, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.12. <hi>I ſaw the dead both ſmall and great ſtanding before the Lord;</hi> they were all ſtanding before God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.31, 32. <hi>The Son of man ſhall come in his glory, and all his holy Angels with him:</hi> the whole hoſt of Angels ſhall be preſent: And what more? <hi>And before him ſhall be gathered all nations:</hi> This ſhall be a great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and in the ſight of God, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and men, all ſhall be done at that day: and in that reſpect there is a great deal of difference.</p>
            <p n="8">8 There is a great deal of difference upon this account; as for common calamities it is poſſible they may be eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped, you may live in the midſt of Gods judgements and yet be preſerved;
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:171179:82"/> yea poſſibly a ſinner for the ſake of ſome that fear the Lord, may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in a common calamity, as was <hi>Noahs</hi> caſe, he and his wife, and his ſons and their wives, all eſcaped the flood; but it was <hi>Noah</hi> was the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſon, the reſt were given in for his ſake: it may be a righteous ſoul beggs preſervation for ſome poor ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners or other, and for their ſakes God gives them a preſervation; but none can be indulged in the day of Chriſt, every one muſt then fall under the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that ſhall be pronounced by Chriſt, whatever it be: There is no way to prevail for indulgence for thy abſence at that day, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.27. <hi>It is appointed for all men once to dye, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that the judgement;</hi> good and bad, all muſt paſs through the gate of death, and muſt all appear before the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-ſeat of Chriſt: and as the wiſe man ſpeaks of death, ſo may I ſpeak of ſucceeding judgement, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 8.8. <hi>No man hath power in the day of death, and there is no diſcharge in that war;</hi> ſo may I ſay, No man hath power in the day of Chriſt, <hi>and there is no diſcharge from that war:</hi> Thou muſt ride out that
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:171179:83"/> ſtorm, and ſee and bear the worſt of it, for thou muſt appear before the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-ſeat of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="9">9. There is yet this difference: ſome that fall under a common calamity, ſuppoſe this of the Plague, God takes away their reaſon, ſo that they do not feel the dread of it; it is no more to them, nor are they ſenſible of any more pain then thoſe that are in health and ſtrength; but in the day of Chriſt we ſhall all ſtand before him in our ſences, we ſhall then know, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand and feel, what the weight, and dread, and majeſty of Chriſt is in that day, and at that time, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.5. <hi>He comes in the clouds, and every eye ſhall ſee him, and they alſo that pierced him;</hi> they that would be moſt willing not to ſee and behold Chriſt, they muſt ſee, their ſences ſhall all be ſet at work, to underſtand what the dread, glory, and majeſty of that day is.</p>
            <p n="10">10. There is this difference alſo: in a common calamity, it may be if it lights upon thee, ſome friend, ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent relation will ſtand by thee, to help, ſupport thee, and bear thee up; but in the day of Chriſt thou muſt ſtand
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:171179:83"/> ſingle. My friends, though theſe be plain things, they may do our ſouls a great deal of good, if God will bleſs them; it is a great relief in a calamity, when the hand of God is upon you, when you are ſick, and weak, and full of pain, if ſome friend will ſtand by to help thee, to bear thee up, and indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to relieve the outward man; but in the day of Chriſt all will ſtand at a diſtance, the knots of all relations (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thoſe onely that are ſpiritual) muſt be at an end when life ends; and when thou comeſt to ſtand before Chriſt, thou muſt ſtand ſingly, naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and alone, none to ſtand by thee, thou wilt have none to befriend thee at that hour, unleſs Chriſt be thy friend; it is well for them that have a Chriſt to befriend them at that day.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only make a little alluſion to that Text that you have, <hi>Matt.</hi> 22.30. When the queſtion was put to Chriſt concerning the woman that had ſeven Husbands, in the Reſurrection, whoſe wife ſhould ſhe be? Anſwer is made, <hi>In the Reſurrection they neither marry, nor give in marriage;</hi> all Relation then ceaſeth: the friend that was unto thee
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:171179:84"/> as thy own ſoul, and thou as dear unto him, in the day of Chriſt, (unleſs there be any ſpiritual tye, unleſs you and he have union with God in Chriſt) he will have no pitty, no tenderneſs for you, but you muſt ſtand alone to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a ſentence from the Lord.</p>
            <p n="11">11. There is this farther difference: any outward calamity, though never ſo ſharp, may be of ſhort continuance; the hand of God may light upon thee in ſuch a diſpenſation as is now abroad, and in a few days it may ſend thee to another world, or the extremity of it may be paſſed over in a little time: but when thou comeſt to ſtand before the judgement-ſeat of Chriſt, the iſſue of that d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y will laſt to all eternity, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.32. <hi>Before him ſhall be gathered all Nations, and he ſhall ſeparate them one from another, as the ſhepherd divideth the ſheep from the goats:</hi> and what ſhall the iſſue of this ſeparation be? In <hi>verſ.</hi> 46. <hi>Theſe ſhall go away into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting puniſhment, but the righteous into life eternal:</hi> eternity will be the reſult and product of thy ſtanding before the judgement-ſeat of Chriſt: calamity, outward diſtreſs, may ſoon come to a
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:171179:84"/> period, but ſtanding before Chriſt will reach thy everlaſting condition.</p>
            <p>And 12. This difference there is alſo between common calamity, and ſtanding before Chriſt; in that the utmoſt dread and worſt part of outward calamity is this, that it lets thee in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the dreadful tribunal of Chriſt; wherefore do you fear, or any that are in fear of a judgement, but onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe poſſibly you conſider that that may let the ſoul in to the judgement-ſeat of Chriſt? but now the dread of the judgement-ſeat of Chriſt, is this, in that it determines thy eſtate for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: I ſay, the dread of any calamity lyeth in this, that poſſibly it may bring thee to death, and ſo let thee in to judgement; but this is the dread of ſtanding before the judgement-ſeat of Chriſt, it lets thee into an everlaſting ſtate, to the paſſing of a ſentence not to be revoked for ever: God many times threatens in outward calamities, and afterwards repeals it, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.8. <hi>How ſhall I give thee up, Oh Ephraim,</hi> &amp;c. God was determining to make <hi>Ephraim</hi> as <hi>Admah,</hi> and to ſet him as <hi>Zeboim,</hi> that is, to cut him off in a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:171179:85"/> and by deſtruction; But how ſhall I do it, ſaies God? His bowells were turned in him, he repented him of the evil, and he was troubled for what he had done: ſo in <hi>Jonah</hi> 9. the people repented, and the Lord repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the evil, and was pleaſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the ſentence he had paſſed upon that City of <hi>Niniveh:</hi> So in <hi>Amos</hi> 4. you have mention made of the Lords repenting, that is, ſome judgement or other he was thinking to ſend upon a people, and yet he revokes the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and reſolves it ſhould not come upon them: but when you come to ſtand before the judgement-ſeat of Chriſt, you ſhall receive a ſentence there that ſhall ſtand for ever, it ſhall ſtand without any recalling.</p>
            <p>And thus I have briefly diſpatched the firſt thing propounded, to ſhew you, that to ſtand before the Son of Man, is a much more weighty and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thing, then ſtanding under any temporal calamity. I do not ſpeak thus to make you ſlight any temporal or common ſtroke, but onely to raiſe up your hearts to a much more ſerious thoughtfulneſs about the ſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:171179:85"/> the Son of man, and to ſhew you that that is a thing much more weighty; which leads me to the ſecond thing propounded for the proſecution of this Point; namely, that ſecure ſinners that are ſo confident that they can laugh the moſt dreadful calamity in the face, they ſhall be made ſerious, and brought to tremble in the day of Chriſt: They ſhall finde it to be no laughing matter. Indeed the Servants of God ſometimes are ſaid to laugh at calamity, but it is in a good ſenſe, <hi>Job</hi> 5.20, 21, 22. <hi>In famine he ſhall redeem thee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>At deſtruction and famine thou ſhalt laugh:</hi> but you muſt know, the ſenſe of that expreſſion here is this, they ſhall not make light of a calamity, they ſhall conſider the dread and Majeſty of God that ſhines forth in it; but when they conſider their ſecurity, through the goodneſs of God, they ſhall look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on calamity as that that is not able to touch them: Such may be the ſafety and ſecurity of the Saints and Servants of God, through his kindneſs, that they may laugh at a calamity, as a thing that ſhall not be able to come nigh them. Such is the wretchedneſs and the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:171179:86"/> of the hearts of ſinners, that the moſt ſtartling judgements do not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken them; let God threaten, they are not moved: And therefore you ſhall finde what the Lord by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet complains of as a great evil; <hi>Wo unto them that draw iniquity with the cords of vanity, and ſin as it were with a cart-rope, Iſaiah</hi> 5.19, 20. Mark what it is, <hi>They ſay, Let him make ſpeed and haſten his work, that we may ſee it:</hi> It was a taunting and deriding ſpeech, wherewith this people mocked the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet: he tells them that judgement would come; <hi>Come,</hi> ſay they, <hi>let us ſee what he will do;</hi> It was a daring and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting ſpeech. And by the way, let me tell you what the reaſon is of the deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſinfulneſs of ſinners, in time of Gods judgement; <hi>They draw,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with the cords of vanity, and ſin as it were with a cart-rope;</hi> that is, they ſin as faſt as they can, they do not minde the judgements of God, if they did, they would put a check upon them; they fear not, come what will, they think it will be well enough with them. That this is the guiſe of ſinners, you ſhall ſee, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.16. <hi>But they
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:171179:86"/> mocked the Meſſengers of God,</hi> &amp;c. Let the Lord threaten what he will, they for their parts were not concerned with it; they mocked the Meſſengers, deſpiſed the Prophets, and all the judgements of God were light in their accounts. And it is no wonder that ſinners fear not judgement, for they fear not ſin, which is a thing that is much more dreadful then judgement, if rightly conſidered, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.9. <hi>Fools make a mock at ſin:</hi> And the very ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Chriſt himſelf, (the moſt dreadful of all diſpenſations) before it comes, ſinners will but mock and ſcoff at it, as you have it, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. ſaies he, They will ſcoff at the coming of Chriſt, at the great Day of the Lord; they will but make a mock of it, and ſay, Where is the Chriſt you talk of? we ſee no preparation to it: <hi>For ſince the fathers fell aſleep, all things continue as they were:</hi> When Chriſt comes in earneſt, he will make them fear in earneſt; and then the moſt daring &amp; confident of ſinners ſhall tremble: it is evident from five or ſix things I would go over very briefly.</p>
            <p n="1">1. From hence, in the day of Chriſt, the conſcience of every ſinner ſhall be
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:171179:87"/> effectually awakened: There ſhall be no ſecure conſcience in the day of Chriſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s appearing. Now, though a ſinner with a ſleepy conſcience may not conſider, may not be affected with and moved by the preſent judgements of God; yet when Chriſt ſhall apear, and conſcience ſhall be awakened with it, it will ſet him into a fit of trembling: For preſent, under word and works, it is poſſible hardneſs of heart may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main upon ſinners. Scripture makes mention of a very deſperate hardneſs of heart upon ſome: it was ſaid of ſome, they were paſt feeling, conſcience was ſo ſtupified, that they had no kind of ſenſe, no kind of tenderneſs at all, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Speaking lies in hypocriſie, having their conſciences ſeared as with a hot Iron:</hi> You know, that that which is ſeared with a hot Iron, if it be the fleſh, it becomes ſenſeleſs, and be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; ſo it is with the conſcience, there are <hi>conſciences ſeared as with hot Irons;</hi> the ſenſe, and vigor, and activity of it is taken away: but in the day of Chriſt this ſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>epy dead conſcience ſhall be quickned: that Scripture in the 9th. chap. of <hi>Mark,</hi> is uſually applyed to
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:171179:87"/> this purpoſe, <hi>v.</hi> 44, 45. You read of a Worm that never dyeth, which is granted on all hands to be the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and this receives a quickning when it comes to ſtand before the Seat of Chriſt, and ſhall remain ſo for ever, with a quickned conſcience ſhall they be caſt into Hell: So the <hi>Acts</hi> 3.20. The time of Chriſts coming, is called, <hi>The time of the reſtitution of all things;</hi> There ſhall be a <hi>reſtitution of all things,</hi> with reſpect to the comfort of the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ints; Therefore it is called, A time of refreſhing to them, 19. <hi>verſ.</hi> When Chriſt ſhall come, there will be a <hi>reſtitution of all things,</hi> to the refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Saints: but mark, It will tend to the miſery of ſinners; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other things, upon this account, becauſe then the conſcience of ſinners ſhall be returned unto them. Man at firſt Creation had a lively active con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that could quickly feel the leaſt ſtirring from God; but that man by ſin hath loſt in a g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eat meaſure: and at that day I am ſpeaking of, conſcience ſhall be reſtored to its activity, life and ſtrength: and what a dread will an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened guilty conſcience put the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:171179:88"/> into? A wakened guilty conſcience, of all things, dreads the preſence of God moſt; it cannot away with that, above any thing. Methinks that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion ſhould help a little this way, that you have concerning <hi>Cain, Gen.</hi> 4.16. <hi>And</hi> Cain <hi>went out from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God:</hi> He was full of guilt, the blood of <hi>Abel</hi> was upon him; he had guilt upon him, and he gat him out of the preſence of God: and ſo <hi>Adam</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and his Wife; what did they? <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.10. <hi>I heard thy voice in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n, and I was afraid:</hi> He had a guilty awakened conſcience, and therefore he could not bear the preſence of the Lord. A poor ſinner! What will he do in the day of Chriſt, when his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſhall be awakened, and it ſhall be guilty enough, and yet he muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the preſence of Chriſt; there ſhall be no refuge for him to run to, nor place where he ſhall be able to hide himſelf. Now upon this account that ſinners will be awakened, they will be filled with trembling.</p>
            <p n="2">2. VVhen Chriſt ſhall come, all the Atheiſm in their hearts will be effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally confuted: You cannot conceive
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:171179:88"/> what a deal of Atheiſm there is in the heart of man by Nature, unleſs you have obſerved it in your own hearts, and that will tell you there is this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm in the heart of man by Nature, they think there is no God, or at leaſt, wiſh there were none; and they are ready to ſay, All this preaching is but to keep us in awe, and to hinder us from living merrily; and with ſuch kind of Atheiſm as this is, the heart of man is fraught by nature, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.1. <hi>The fool hath ſaid in his heart, There is no God:</hi> and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.4. <hi>The wicked through the pride of his countenance will not ſeek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God: God is not in all his thoughts;</hi> or as it may be rendred, All his thoughts are, There is no God: it may be he will not ſay ſo openly, but he doth it in his heart, and he thinks ſo: Few will ſpeak it openly, though they have ſecret thoughts that there is no God, nor Chriſt, nor judgement to come.

Doubtleſs there are very many that ſhall never be able to ſtand before Chriſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.23. the queſtion was put, <hi>Are there few that ſhall be ſaved?</hi> Chriſt anſwers, <hi>Strive to enter in at the ſtreight gate, for many I ſay unto you ſhall ſeek and ſhall not be able to enter:</hi> and hence it is that it is ſaid, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.22, 23. <hi>Many will ſay unto me in that day, Lord, Lord,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now in treating on the fourth, who they are that ſhall not ſtand, I ſhall ſhew you that there are ten ſorts of perſons that will never be able to ſtand before the Son of man: The Lord grant we may not be of that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Ungodly ſinners, openly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, who ſpend their days without any awe of God upon them, they are perſons never like to be honored by Chriſt in his day, and at his appearance and coming, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.5. <hi>The ungodly

               </gap>ect of Duty; the ſinners, ſuch as live <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n the acting of all impiety, ſaith he, theſe ſhall not ſtand in the judgement, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.18. <hi>If the righteous ſcarcely be ſaved, where ſhall the ſinner and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly appear?</hi> If they find ſome diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in aſcending the mount of glory, what then ſhall ſinners do? doubtleſs they will never be able to ſtand in the preſence of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Such as promote and incourage ſin in others, they are not like to be owned, and honored, and promoted by Chriſt in his day: ſome there are that are ſuch and ſo good factors for the Devil, that they wonderfully promote his trade in the world, and as a recompence of all their trouble they ſhall receive the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary of eternal miſery; whatever ſouls they are that are ſo in love with ſin, and the ways and works thereof, that they help it on, and further it by what means they can, muſt never expect to be owned and honored by Chriſt when they ſhall ſtand before him at his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-ſeat: there are ſuch in the world as the Prophet complains of, <hi>Ezek.</hi>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:171179:93"/> 13.22. <hi>Who ſtrengthen the hands of the wicked;</hi> many ways there are to do it, but it is miſerable work, whoever is found in it: we promote and incourage ſin, either when we provoke and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice unto it, as <hi>Solomon</hi> warns his ſon, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.10. <hi>When ſinners intice thee, conſent not to them;</hi> there are ſuch ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners that in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thus do the wicked great men of the earth, that compell others unto their idolatry, and to ſhare in their abominations, as <hi>Jeroboam</hi> did in 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17.21, &amp;c. They alſo promote ſin <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n others, who do labour to exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate and leſſen ſin, and make people believe it is not what it is, to the end they may leſs fear and dread it, and go on in it with the more confidence; ſuch a kind of people as the Lord by the Prophet meets with in <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Ye have wearied me,</hi> &amp;c. when you tell people ſin is not ſuch a thing as ſome
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:171179:93"/> would have you believe, and he will love you for all that, this is an inticing unto evil: I but what will become of them? that will you ſee in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.32. <hi>Who knowing the judgement,</hi> &amp;c, in which words you have both the ſin and puniſment that ſhall follow upon the ſinner: the ſin is expreſſed, that they ſin, and love to have others do ſo; the puniſhment is implyed, they that ſo ſin are worthy of death, and that they ſhall have, they ſhall have their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit, not life from Chriſt, nor ſhall they live with Chriſt, but everlaſting death is their demerit, and that they ſhall have, that ſhall be their portion; and ſo that <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.19. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall break any of theſe little command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and teach men ſo to do,</hi> &amp;c. who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall ſin, and incourage others in it, what ſhall become of him? he ſhall be leaſt in the Kingdom of Heaven: the words are a figurative ſpeech, where leſs is ſpoken then intended: <hi>leaſt,</hi> that is, he ſhalbe ſo little, that he ſhall not be at all in the Kingdom of heaven: That is the ſecond ſort that ſhall not ſtand before the Son of man. Onely I would put in a caution, That it is poſſible
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:171179:94"/> good ſouls, even the Lords own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, may ſometimes prove a means of incouraging ſin in others, and that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by ſome ill example, as ſuch a caſe is intimated, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.10. <hi>If any man,</hi> &amp;c. The example of a ſtronger Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian may incourage a weak one to do things againſt his conſcience, things he is not ſatisfied in, and ſo it may be a ſin unto that weak one, he may ſin being led to it by the example of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; or we may further ſin in others, when we do not reſtrain it according as we may and ought: Thus did <hi>Eli,</hi> who was a very good man, but yet he did further the ſin of his ſons, in that he did not reſtrain them, he did onely give them a gentle and mild reproof, when he ſhould have put a reſtraint upon them, as you may read, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.22. and forward, <hi>Now Eli was very old,</hi> &amp;c. in a mild way he reproves them, when as he was a Magiſtrate he ſhould have put a reſtraint upon them: and ſee how God puniſhes this upon him in <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.13. It is not enough to reprove a ſin, but where we can we ought to reſtrain it, as Maſters, Parents, Magiſtrates, and the like, that is their duty, and
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:171179:94"/> they that are not faithful in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of it, may be thereby an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courager of ſin in others: only this note, that though ſinners may encourage ſin, and Saints may incourage ſin too, yet it is greatly different; Saints may incour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age ſin eventually and accidentally, but not inten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ionally; it is not their deſign: ſinners do it deſignedly, and Saints acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally, and that is a wide difference.</p>
            <p>To proceed, thirdly, They may not expect to ſtand in the day of Chriſt, that ruſh on upon ways of ſin, contrary to light and convictions received, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Becauſe that when they knew God,</hi> &amp;c. in a due proportion to the light we have received, ſuch ſhould our walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and acting be, and he that ſins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his light, ſins greatly: Many make dreadful havock of their light, and great inrodes upon their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: You read in <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.27. The ſpirit of a man is the candle of the Lord; the conſcience of a man it is the candle of the Lord, and we often ſin againſt it, untill we ſin it out, although this cannot be done at a cheap rate, and yet how often do we do it! <hi>Pſal.</hi> 125.5. <hi>As for ſuch as turn aſide, the Lord ſhall
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:171179:95"/> lead them forth with the workers of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity;</hi> in which is implyed, not only that God will leave them to ſin as the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked do, but to the ſame puniſhment that doth attend and betide the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of iniquity; and alſo to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe take that text again, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.32. <hi>Who knowing the juſt judgements of God;</hi> there is a great emphaſis, in that they that know that he that ſinneth ſo and ſo what he doth deſerve, they are like to fall under his juſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.47. <hi>The ſervant that knows his Lords will,</hi> &amp;c. What, ſhall he be rewarded? No, <hi>But he ſhall be bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with many ſtripes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A fourth ſort of perſons that ſhall never ſtand before Chriſt, are they that turn the grace of God and Chriſt into wantonneſs; they that from the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God in the Goſpel, take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſtrengthen their hands in ways of rebellion againſt God and Chriſt: I tell you ſuch ſouls will have a ſad ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to make in the day of Chriſt, and will ſtand with much paleneſs of face, and dejection of ſpirit; in <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. of <hi>Judes</hi> Epiſtle, we are pointed to ſuch a people, who turned the grace of
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:171179:95"/> God into laſciviouſneſs; that is, Make uſe of the grace of God in the Goſpel, as an occaſion to laſciviouſneſs: Oh it is ſad indeed to make the greateſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy a prop and fartherer of the greateſt iniquity! <hi>Paul</hi> tells us in <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.11. That ſin took occaſion by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment; that is, there is ſuch an enmity and contrariety in the heart of man naturally againſt God, and the minde of God, that the very command to holineſs is a ſpur and furtherance unto wickedneſs; ſuch is the enmity that is in the heart unto God. Now it is a very great ſin, that the Law that is intended to keep from ſin, ſhould be an occaſion of ſin; it is a great aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but it is much more a great ſin, when the Mercy and Grace of God that ſhould be the greateſt hindrance, and let, in the way of ſin, if that ſhould become an occaſion of ſin, and a means to further it: The Rule is, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.1. <hi>My little Children, theſe things I write, that you ſin not. And if any man ſin, we have an Advocate,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>We have an Advocate;</hi> we have a Chriſt, to the end that it ſhould keep us in from ſin, and not that it ſhould
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:171179:96"/> be an occaſion to ſin; and in <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.1. ſaies <hi>Paul, What ſhall we ſay then? ſhall we ſin that grace may abound? God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid,</hi> God forbid that the kindneſs of God in the Goſpel ſhould be a means to further us in any provocation, that were a dreadful evil. And yet this is the guiſe of ſome poor Creatures; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath found out a way for Pardon and Reconciliation, therefore ſome poor ſouls venture upon ſin the more boldly: And what will be the iſſue of this? Oh ſuch ſhall ſmart and ſuffer dearly for it: they ſhall be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed after the Example of <hi>Sodom,</hi> in the ſeventh <hi>verſe</hi> of <hi>Judes E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Such as neglect and ſlight the Goſpel of Chriſt, and the Grace of Chriſt in the Goſpel: They do not much minde it, God he offers us fairly, he offers us a great deal of kindneſs and mercy in the Goſpel; but we do not minde it, and what will the reſult of it be? <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4, 5. <hi>Or deſpiſeſt thou the riches of his goodneſs?</hi> &amp;c. It hath been the Lot of the Goſpel to meet with very courſe and rough uſage, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.4, 5. And <hi>Again, he ſent forth other
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:171179:96"/> ſervants,</hi> &amp;c. They ſlighted the offer as a thing not worth the conſidering, not worth the giving heed to; let thy preparation and dinner go as it will, they made light of it: But what will the iſſue of this be? what will this come to? This is not the way to ſtand before Chriſt; look to the <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.3. <hi>How ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect ſo great ſalvation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Secret Hypocrites and Apoſtates will never be able to ſtand in the day of Chriſt. Secret Hypocrites that profeſs to be for Chriſt, but are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly againſt him, their hearts are not with him; ſuch ſouls will come off with ſhame in the day of Chriſt: Therefore you finde what is ſaid, <hi>Job</hi> 36.13. <hi>The hypocrite in heart heaps up wrath,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.51. intimates to us that the portion of hypocrites ſhall be of all the moſt ſad and diſmal portion. And alſo for Apoſtates that have begun in the ſpirit, but do end in the fleſh; that have profeſſed a love to Chriſt, but really have their hearts at a diſtance from Chriſt; ſuch as <hi>Paul</hi> wiſhes the <hi>Galathians</hi> might never prove, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Are ye ſo fooliſh? ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:171179:97"/> begun in the ſpirit, are ye now made perfect by the fleſh?</hi> Such ſouls as ſhall do thus, they will finde their caſe ſad at laſt; ſuch as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.19. that make <hi>Shipwrack of faith and a good conſcience:</hi> That have profeſſed the Faith, and have had ſome light and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of Conſcience, but have thrown off all: how will it be with ſuch? <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.23. <hi>Hold faſt the profeſſion of your Faith without wavering,</hi> &amp;c. and 25. <hi>verſ. Forſake not the aſſembling your ſelves together, as the manner of ſome is:</hi> For if you ſin after the receiving the knowledge of the Truth, it will be ſad: For, ſaies he, it is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Carnal and Formal profeſſors that ſet out and keep up in a Profeſſion, but are without ſpirit and life, that have nothing but a form and outſide of godlineſs, without the power: Such ſouls there are in the world: But alas, ſuch ſouls will ſit down ſhort of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable enjoyment of Chriſt. How many are there in days in which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion is crowned, that attend diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon opportunity? But how little is
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:171179:97"/> that conſidered, in <hi>John</hi> 1.24. <hi>God is a Spirit, and will be worſhipped in ſpirit and in truth?</hi> How many poor creatures are there that onely minde a little life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, heartleſs worſhpiping of God? <hi>Though the number of the Children of Iſrael be as the ſand of the Sea, a Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Though Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors be as the ſand of the Sea, a great many; yet but a remnant ſhall be ſaved: And why but a remnant? it is becauſe though they were <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet they were but formal, they are ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Sapleſs profeſſors: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore becauſe they are but ſo, but a rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſhall eſcape.</p>
            <p n="8">8. I might alſo add thoſe moral men, that carry things right between man and man; yet that is not enough to bear up the ſoul in the preſence of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Faint ſeekers, that have ſome faint deſires, and a h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The preaching of <hi>John</hi> had put another ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit into the people, that they were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven preſſing into the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; <hi>The Kingdom of heaven ſuffereth violence:</hi> Many were preſſing into the Kingdom of God, and the violent they would take no denial; they would take the Kingdom of Heaven by force. Theſe hot-metled ſouls, they were hot upon the Kingdom of Heaven, and there was no ſatisfying them without it: but the Faint ſeekers will be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed.</p>
            <p n="10">10. It may be they that have ſome raiſed confidence, though upon bad grounds, and think to challenge Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with as much boldneſs as any, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them there may be ſuch that ſhall fall ſhort, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.22, 23. They ſhall come unto him, and ſay, <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> &amp;c. They ſhall come and chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge an entrance, with a great deal of boldneſs and confidence, as if they doubted not of their reception and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment; but yet he ſhall ſay unto

But then if theſe ſhall not ſtand, who are they, and what muſt they be, that ſhall ſtand before him with joy? That is the fourth thing.</p>
            <p>There are ſouls that ſhall ſtand. Chriſt hath not dyed in vain, he ſhall ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I ſhall give you this deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of him that ſhall ſtand before the Son of man: He is ſuch a one, who having denied and renounced his own righteouſneſs, hath put on Chriſts Righteouſneſs; is renewed in the Inner man, and bound in ſpirit for God; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to be found in the whole VVill of God, both in doing and in ſuffering: Of ſuch an one I ſhall ſay, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaks, in the <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24.5. <hi>He ſhall receive the bleſſing from the Lord,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:171179:99"/> and righteouſneſs from the God of his ſalvation.</hi> I ſhall take this deſcription in parts, and clear up every part of it, and ſhall beg of you to put the queſtion unto your own hearts, How far you can experience ſuch a VVork of God upon your own ſpirits?</p>
            <p n="1">1. He that ſhall be accounted worthy to ſtand before the Son of man, is one that hath denyed and renounced his own righteouſneſs; he is one that is brought to ſee he hath no righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his own; and therefore deſires to give up all the thoughs of hanging upon any righteouſneſs of his own whatever: He is one, I ſay, that ſeeth he hath no righteouſneſs of his own; and that ſight ariſeth from the ſight of his Original pollution, and of his actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al departure from the Lord: he ſees his Original pollution, and that makes him cry out as <hi>Job, Job</hi> 14.4. <hi>Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one:</hi> It makes him cry out as <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 51.5. <hi>Behold, I was ſhapen in ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and in ſin did my mother conceive me.</hi> And the ſoul alſo ſeeth its own actual departure from the Lord, and that makes it cry out as they in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 64.6.

            <p>Now my Friends, conſider what have been the dealings of God with your ſpirits, what have you experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced of ſuch workings upon your ſoul? Have you been brought to ſee your own natural pollution, the defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your ſouls with guilt and filth by nature? and have you been brought to ſee your turnings from God in your whole courſe? and hath it wrought this upon you, to ſee that you have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of your own to commend you to God? that all in you, and all without you, is but what may be a provocation to the Divine Majeſty, and that you do renounce it all as dung and droſs?</p>
            <p n="2">2. You muſt put on Chriſts R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ghte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, for the putting off your own will not do it; you muſt have a righteouſneſs, the putting off your own muſt be followed with the putting on of Chriſts; and with that you may be able to ſtand before the Lord in the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:171179:100"/> great day: This you finde is our Duty, and that to which we are called, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Come unto me:</hi> Coming unto Chriſt, it is believing, taking hold of his Righteouſneſs: It is not enough that you know there is a Righteouſneſs held forth, a Righteouſneſs offered; but it muſt be taken, you muſt put on Chriſt, as the phraſe of Scripture is: <hi>Paul</hi> you finde did thus, in that <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.7. <hi>I count all dung for Chriſt;</hi> and in the 8. <hi>verſ. Yea doubtleſs I count all loſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>All loſs for Chriſt!</hi> and in the 9. <hi>verſ.</hi> you have the reaſon, that <hi>I may be found in him, not having my own righteouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c. Mark, he made it his buſineſs not only to put off his own, but to put on Chriſts Righteouſneſs; that was his care, And this, I ſay, will do the work: the ſoul ſtanding clad with the Robes of Chriſts Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, will ſtand with comfort in the day of Chriſt. I will recommend to your conſideration, that <hi>Revel.</hi> 7 9. you read of <hi>A great multitude, which no man could number, that ſtood before the Throne, and ſtood before the Lamb, clothed with white, and palms in their hands.</hi> And who are they that are
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:171179:101"/> thus before the Throne? In the 13, 14. <hi>verſes,</hi> he tells you, <hi>They were they that had waſhed their Robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb;</hi> and in the next <hi>verſ.</hi> he adds, <hi>Therefore are they before the Throne; they had waſhed their Robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb:</hi> That is, they had the Robes of Righteouſneſs, that were purchaſed by the Blood of Chriſt; and the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt was found upon them, and upon this account they ſtood before the Lamb: and hence in <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.11, 12. <hi>When the feaſt was made, and the King comes to view his gueſts, he ſaith unto one of them, How comeſt thou in hither, not having on a Wedding-garment?</hi> He wanted the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, that was the Wedding-garment; that not being found upon him, he muſt be caſt out to be a companion of them that knew not God. Now this is the queſtion; Have you put off your own Righteouſneſs, and put on Chriſts, without which there is no ſtanding, with which you may and will ſtand before the Son of man? What is the anſwer of your hearts in this caſe? You will ſay, It is
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:171179:101"/> a hard matter to determine whether I have put on Chriſts Righteouſneſs or no. I anſwer, Whether it be hard or eaſie to determine whether you have done it or no, yet this is concluded on that it muſt be done, if we would ſtand before Chriſt: but a little to help you, before I leave it, conſider theſe two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Conſider that the putting on the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, it is but one act. The ſoul ſeeth a Beauty and Excellency in Chriſt, and likes him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is a conſenting act, a Marriage-act: when the ſoul as it likes Chriſt, ſo is willing to receive him according to the terms of the Goſpel, at that time it doth put on Chriſt, and his Righteouſneſs. Now this is the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion you are to ask your ſelves; Have you found ſuch a conſenting unto Chriſt, ſuch a giving up your ſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, upon the terms of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel? You like him, and approve him, and liking of him, you willingly take him upon the terms he hath offered himſelf unto you: If you can ſay, You have found ſuch an act paſs between
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:171179:102"/> Chriſt and your ſouls; it is well, and it may aſſure you, that you will ſtand among them that ſhall ſtand before Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But then thirdly, in the Deſcription I told you the ſoul is renewed: Old things muſt paſs away, Chriſt muſt be ſanctification, as well as Righteouſneſs, <hi>John</hi> 3.3. <hi>Except a man be born again, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> There muſt be a new Birth, a new work of God muſt paſs upon the ſoul; that renewing work it is in all the powers and faculties of the ſoul: The old Nature it is in ſome meaſure weakened in all the faculties of the ſoul, though not wholly driven out of any of them: There is ſomething of God ſpread over the whole ſoul; but yet not ſo, but that there is room for the ſoul, to complain as <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.3. <hi>Who ſhall deliver me from this body of death?</hi> The ſoul it is brought to thoughts of God that once it had not, and thoughts of ſin that once it had not; it is a real, though but an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect work; it is a work really begun upon the ſoul, really wrought upon the heart, though not preſently perfected:
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:171179:102"/> It is an earneſt and pledge of that that ſhall be wrought out and compleated in the ſeaſon thereof. Now here is the queſtion you are to put to your hearts: What beginnings of this Work have you upon your ſouls? H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ve you thoughts of God you had not, and thoughts of ſin you had not, and thoughts of holineſs that you were once utter ſtrangers unto?</p>
            <p n="4">4. This is in the deſcription, the ſoul is made to be for Chriſt, <hi>Titus</hi> 2.13, 14. <hi>Who gave himſelf for us, that he might purifie to himſelf a peculiar people,</hi> &amp;c. Chriſt did purchaſe a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to himſelf: Time was thou wert all for ſin, and Sathan, but now thou art for Chriſt; thy Vote is on his ſide, though ſometimes ſin and Sathan may carry it againſt thee.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The bent of the heart is for God the ſhip that is bound for the <hi>Indies</hi> (a long voyage) it meets with many croſs winds, and is often driven back; but yet being bound for the ſame place, it ſtill ſets out with the firſt fair wind, and makes forward as much as it can: It is thus with the ſoul that ſhall ſtand with Chriſt, it is bound for God, for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:171179:103"/> it meets with many croſs winds; the winds makes the waves of the ſea boiſterous, and the ſoul is brought back again to as bad, or it may be, to its own apprehenſion, a worſe condition then at firſt, when it ſet out for God, yet bound for God it is, and therefore it improves all its opportunities for God; that is the bent and frame of ſuch a ſoul, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.8. <hi>The deſires of our ſoul are toward thee,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="6">6. It is deſirous to be found in the whole will of God; not that it is always found in the will of God, but yet the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires are after it, that is the inclination of the heart, &amp; to be found in the whole will of God, in one part as well as another: <hi>Caleb</hi> was a type of them that ſhall ſtand before Chriſt, <hi>Num.</hi> 14.24. <hi>But my ſervant Caleb, becauſe he had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother ſpirit, and had followed the Lord fully,</hi> &amp;c. He was to go to <hi>Canaan,</hi> and he was a type of all that ſhall inhabit the heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> that ſhall ſit down in the land of reſt; they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of ſuch ſpirits, that they are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to follow the Lord fully, to be found in the whole will of God, in the duties of the firſt Table, in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:171179:103"/> of God with his people in their family, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.3. Therefore called the godly man: They are for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Table-duties, to do the duty of their places and relations towards God and all men, therefore <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11. <hi>The grace of God teacheth to deny all ungodlineſs and worldly luſts,</hi> &amp;c. Now ſee, how is it with thee? thou haſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions remaining, ſin dwelling in thee, and thou art found but little in the way and work of God; but which way is the bent of thy heart? which way do the ſtrongeſt deſires of thy heart run?</p>
            <p n="7">7. It is willing not onely to do but to ſuffer for God, to be true to his name, his honor and glory, whatever it may coſt him; to ſubmit his life, liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, eſtate, honor, or whatever he hath, to the will of Chriſt: if the Lord wills me to ſuffer, I will undergo it, if I may but any way further and promote his glory; that is the requirement of Chriſt in <hi>Mark.</hi> 8.38. <hi>Whoever ſhall be aſhamed of me,</hi> &amp;c. he that will not own Chriſt, and his way and work in the face of the utmoſt hazard that he can run, he ſhall not be owned of
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:171179:104"/> Chriſt when he ſhall come: ſo <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. <hi>Fear none of thoſe things, be faithful to death,</hi> &amp;c. So conſider and commune with your ſpirits in this matter; are you willing to do his will, and ſuffer his will? is it the deſign of your ſpirits, to ſtand perfect in the whole will of God? It is good if ſo, and ſuch as I have here deſcribed ſhall be ſure to ſtand before Chriſt, whoever be rejected in that day.</p>
            <p>And this brings me to the fifth thing, to ſhew you what is the beſt frame that the ſoul ſhould be moſt ambitious of, and that will beſt fit it to ſtand before the Son of m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o ſtand before Chriſt in the day of Chriſt? There are theſe five things neceſſary, if you would be able to meet Chriſt without any conſternation of ſpi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>it, if you would be able to meet him with ſetled confidence &amp; boldneſs, beſides what I have already laid down.</p>
            <p>Five things are needful, 1. To have the love of God in Chriſt witneſſed and ſealed up to the ſoul: It is a great mercy to have an intereſt in Chriſt, to have taken hold on his righteouſneſs; but it is a further and greater mercy, to have the love of God in Chriſt wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:171179:104"/> and manifeſted, and ſealed up to the ſoul by the Spirit of Chriſt; ſouls, this is that mercy which the Saints have been breathing after, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Lift up the light of thy countenance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us;</hi> this is that mercy which the Saints have prized above the deareſt and beſt of all the mercies of this life, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 163.3. <hi>Becauſe thy loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is better then life,</hi> &amp;c. life is better then any other thing in this world, but the love of God manifeſted to the ſoul that is better then life; this is that that the Saints of God have travelled for, and for which they are travelling, for which they are waiting upon the Lord from time to time, and from duty to duty; this is that that their ſouls are ſet upon, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.4. <hi>One thing have I deſired of the Lord, and that will I ſeek after, that I may dwell in the houſe of the Lord to behold his face,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.1. <hi>O God, thou art my God, early will I ſeek thee,</hi> &amp;c. This is that the ſoul of the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> was ſeeking after; this is that that carries the ſoul couragiouſly and comfortably through the moſt rugged and unpleaſing paths and paſſages it meets with in this world, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.3. <hi>We
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:171179:105"/> glory in tribulations;</hi> and what is it that makes the ſoul glory in tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? ſays he, Becauſe the Love of God is ſhed abroad in our hearts by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, that is the inſtrument to do that work upon the ſoul, that is it that makes the ſoul rejoyce in, and go chearfully through, whatever irkſome providence it may poſſibly meet with in the world: it hath the light of Gods countenance, a ſence of his love and favour; it hath the good will of God ſealed up to it by the Spirit of Chriſt, and this is that that will give the ſoul the greateſt boldneſs in the day of Chriſt, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10, 11. Give all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence that you may be found of him in peace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by this means you ſhall be carryed with the greateſt chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and comfort unto the day and coming of our Lord Jeſus.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This is needful, that the ſoul be weaned from this world, and diſ-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to all the intanglements and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrances of it; that it ſit looſe from the cares and comforts of this world; this is requiſite to be the frame of thoſe that would meet with Chriſt with comfort and boldneſs: You ſhall
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:171179:105"/> find the things of this world are of a very hurtful tendency to the ſouls of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he Saints, they do a wonderful deal of harm; they are often a means to carry off the heart from God, if it be not exceedingly careful: therefore Chriſt gives this counſel, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.25. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſay unto you, Take no thought for your life,</hi> &amp;c. be not much taken up with the things and concernments of this life: Why what is the hazard? why, ſaies he, in <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. <hi>No man can ſerve two maſters,</hi> &amp;c. Let not the heart run out too much after the world, for fear the world take the heart away from God; a man cannot have his heart too much let out to this world, but it will draw the ſoul too much from Chriſt, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.3, 4. <hi>Thou therefore indure hardneſs: No man that warreth entang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth himſelf with the affairs of this life:</hi> If you are for Chriſt, and ever mean to do Chriſt any ſervice, make this your care, that the heart be not taken up with the concerns of this life: if you let it out to things below, Chriſt will have little of your love, and little of your ſervice by this means; ſo that I ſay is an excellent frame in order to
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:171179:106"/> the meeting with Chriſt with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt comfort and boldneſs, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.34. <hi>Take heed to your ſelves, leſt at any time,</hi> &amp;c. take heed your hearts are not ſwallowed up with things below, and ſo that day come upon you unawares: whoſoever hath his heart too much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the things of this life, the day of Chriſt will take him at a diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, he will not be able to meet Chriſt with ſo much boldneſs as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he might: Chriſt in <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. gives his diſciples this counſel, <hi>verſ.</hi> 35. <hi>Let your loyns be girded about,</hi> &amp;c. What muſt we be if we would be found in the greateſt poſture of fitneſs for the Lord? Why, <hi>let your loyns be girded about:</hi> The loyns here, is that that is called elſewhere the loyns of the mind, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.13. Now theſe are the affections and workings of the heart, which muſt be girt up, and not ſuffered to hang looſe to the things of this world, not ſuffered to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der after the concernments of this world, that will not do well; but you mu t have them ſetled upon and kept cloſe to due and proper objects: Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions

               </gap> needful, that grace be in its act and exerciſe. I tell you the ſoul may have grace in the heart, but yet if you would meet with Chriſt with that boldneſs and comfort that it is fit we ſhould aim at, it is neceſſary more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over that the habit be drawn forth into exerciſe. Grace in the heart of a Saint, it is not there to be uſeleſs, but it is there ſeated, that it may from thence ſhine forth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine before men,</hi> &amp;c. The exerciſe of Grace is a very grateful and pleaſing thing to our Lord Jeſus: he takes very much delight in it, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Come, ſaies he, let me ſee thy countenance,</hi> &amp;c. The exerciſe of Grace, in a Saint, is pleaſing and delightful to our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; and then is it that Grace is in its excellency, then the ſweetneſs of it is manifeſted, when it is exerciſed, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.12. ſaies the Spouſe, <hi>When the King ſits at his table, my ſpicknard ſends forth the ſmell thereof:</hi> That Spicknard and other precious Oyntments, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Graces of the Spirit of God in the heart of a Saint: and when ſhe

            <p n="4">4. Communion with God, and a holy converſation maintained and kept up, is very neceſſary, if we would meet with Chriſt with comfort and boldneſs. Communion with God, which are thoſe ſweet interchanges of love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and the ſoul, the preſerving and maintaining as well as getting whereof, is much the duty, and much the excellency and glory of a Chriſtian, to carry it ſo, that you may not give Chriſt occaſion to ſtand as a ſtranger unto the ſoul; to preſerve the Unity and Amity between Chriſt and the ſoul, is much the Duty of a poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: it was the miſery and unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Spouſe, that ſhe was want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that work, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.2. When Chriſt invites her unto opportunities of Communion with himſelf, ſhe ſaies, <hi>I have put off my coat,</hi> &amp;c. She trifles away that opportunity, and out of a ſlothful ſpirit neglects it; and this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned a ſtrangeneſs between him and her for ſome time after: The avoiding of this is much our wiſdom, and will

            </p>
            <p n="5">5.

            <p>I have already ſhewed you what kind of perſons they muſt be that ſhall ſtand before Chriſt, that it muſt be one that hath renounced his own righteouſneſs,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:171179:110"/> and put on Chriſts Righteouſneſs, and is renewed in the inner man, and bound in ſpirit for God, deſirous to be found in his Will both by doing and ſuffering: you may reflect upon what hath been ſaid, and conſult your ſpirits thereby. But here you will ſay, Whether have I received Chriſt or no, that is that that ſticks with me, and I cannot an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer that to my own ſatisfaction. Why? conſider, Oh ſoul, thou mayſt know it, by the precious thoughts, and high eſteem thou haſt of Chriſt! 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7. <hi>To you therefore which believe he is precious:</hi> and you may turn it thus; You to whom Chriſt is precious, you believe in him: You ſay, He is preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and worth a world, but whether he be yours, that is the queſtion.

I would ſay, Is there any that have ſuch workings of heart? Why, what is the ground of it? what is it that fills you with this fear?

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:171179:112"/> I may ſay unto ſuch a ſoul as I am now ſpeaking to; he will ſit as a refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners fire, he will purifie, but he will not deſtroy; he will take away thy droſs, he will conquer thy corruption, but thee he will ſave. I but, ſaies the ſoul, I dread the thoughts of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and therefore ſure it will not be to be born by me. To that I anſwer, Thy preſent apprehenſion is no ground from whence thou mayſt make a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain concluſion; for wicked men (ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it) they do not dread the coming of Chriſt, they make a light matter of it, and yet it ſhall be dreadful unto them: So thou doſt dread his coming, and the thoughts of it are irkſome to thee, but it may be, it may not be dreadful when it doth come: we have other thoughts of God then we ſhould have, many times; and therefore the Prophet in <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.17. he prayes, <hi>Be not thou a terrour unto me:</hi> He did miſtake God; God he intended to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver him, and not to be a terrour to him: and ſo we are apt to think that Chriſt will be a terrour unto us, when it is no ſuch matter, when he comes only
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:171179:113"/> to take us unto himſelf, to ſet us with himſelf in glory. And that is the ſecond.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Will the day of Chriſts appearing be ſo dreadful? How ſhould it quicken and ſtir up our hearts then, to get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome readineſs for that day? Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives I might give you many; but let this ſuffice, the coming of the Lord draweth nigh; not according to that expreſſion, <hi>A thouſand years is as one day,</hi> and ſo God may ſay it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Oh the ſigns that we have of the Son of man! Immediately before the tribulation of that day, <hi>The Sun ſhall be darkned, and the Moon ſhall not give her light,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 21.25.

Oh, ſaies the ſoul, what ſhall I do! I a rebel againſt Chriſt, is there any hope for me, that I may yet make peace? my heart is full of fear, what I ſhall do when Chriſt ſhall ſit upon the Throne. I will give thee anſwer, ſoul, in alluſion to that caſe between <hi>Adonijah</hi> and <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon: Adonijah</hi> riſes up in rebellion, ſcrambles for the Crown, but <hi>Solomon</hi> was crown'd before him, and in the 1 <hi>King.</hi> 1.15, 52. <hi>It was told</hi> Solomon, <hi>ſaying,</hi> Adonijah <hi>ſaith, Let King</hi> Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>ſwear I ſhall not dye,</hi> &amp;c. I allude to it, and I think it doth point to what I am ſpeaking of. Thou haſt been a rebel againſt Chriſt; thou heareſt the

It may be, that is thy language: take the anſwer of Chriſt the true <hi>Solomon, If thou ſhew thy ſelf a worthy man, there ſhall not a hair of thine head fall to the earth;</hi> that is, if thou wilt lay down thy arms, and come and ſubmit unto Chriſt heartily, and ſincerely; if thou wilt come and bow before him, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him for thine Head, Lord and Law-giver, the Lord Jeſus gives his royal Word, <hi>Not a hair of thy head ſhall fall to the ground:</hi> But if thou wilt continue in thy rebellion, and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity be found in you, you ſhall dye. Now ſoul, what is the anſwer of thy heart? art thou purpoſed in the ſtrength of the Lord, to come and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to Jeſus? If ſo, thou ſheweſt thy ſelf a worthy man, and things ſhall then go well with thee, and thou mayſt
